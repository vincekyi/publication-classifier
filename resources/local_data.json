It can achieve high alignment accuracy at the expense of\nrelatively long runtimes for large-scale input datasets. In this work we present \nMSAProbs-MPI, a distributed-memory parallel version of the multithreaded MSAProbs\ntool that is able to reduce runtimes by exploiting the compute capabilities of\ncommon multicore CPU clusters. Our performance evaluation on a cluster with 32\nnodes (each containing two Intel Haswell processors) shows reductions in\nexecution time of over one order of magnitude for typical input datasets.\nFurthermore, MSAProbs-MPI using eight nodes is faster than the GPU-accelerated\nQuickProbs running on a Tesla K20. Another strong point is that MSAProbs-MPI can \ndeal with large datasets for which MSAProbs and QuickProbs might fail due to time\nand memory constraints, respectively.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code\nin C ++ and MPI running on Linux systems as well as a reference manual are\navailable at http://msaprobs.sourceforge.net CONTACT:\njgonzalezd@udc.esSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at\nBioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Most existing scaffolding tools adopt scaffold\ngraph approaches. However, due to repetitive regions in genome, sequencing\nerrors, and uneven sequencing depth, constructing an accurate scaffold graph is\nstill a challenge task.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we present a novel algorithm (called BOSS), which employs\npaired reads for scaffolding. To construct a scaffold graph, BOSS utilizes the\ndistribution of insert size to decide whether an edge between two vertices\n(contigs) should be added and how an edge should be weighed. Moreover, BOSS\nadopts an iterative strategy to detect spurious edges whose removal can guarantee\nno contradictions in the scaffold graph. Based on the scaffold graph constructed,\nBOSS employs a heuristic algorithm to sort vertices (contigs) and then generates \nscaffolds. The experimental results demonstrate that BOSS produces more\nsatisfactory scaffolds, compared with other popular scaffolding tools on real\nsequencing data of four genomes.\nAVAILABILITY: BOSS is publicly available for download at\nhttps://github.com/bioinfomaticsCSU/BOSS CONTACT: jxwang@mail.csu.edu.cn\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author (2016).

The proposed tests are adaptive at both the \nSNP- and trait-levels; that is, they account for possibly varying association\npatterns (e.g. signal sparsity levels) across SNPs and traits, thus maintaining\nhigh power across a wide range of situations. Furthermore, the proposed methods\nare general: they can be applied to mixed types of traits, and to Z-statistics or\nP-values as summary statistics obtained from either a single GWAS or a\nmeta-analysis of multiple GWAS.

These signatures have been identified from high\nthroughput sequencing data generated from cancer genomes by using non-negative\nmatrix factorisation (NMF) techniques. Current methods based on optimisation\ntechniques are strongly sensitive to initial conditions due to high\ndimensionality and nonconvexity of the NMF paradigm. In this context, an\nimportant question consists in the determination of the actual number of\nsignatures that best represent the data. The extraction of mutational signatures \nfrom high-throughput data still remains a daunting task.\nRESULTS: Here we present a new method for the statistical estimation of\nmutational signatures based on an empirical Bayesian treatment of the NMF model. \nWhile requiring minimal intervention from the user, our method addresses the\ndetermination of the number of signatures directly as a model selection problem. \nIn addition, we introduce two new concepts, of significant clinical relevance for\nevaluating the mutational profile. The advantages brought by our approach are\nshown by the analysis of real and synthetic data. The later is used to compare\nour approach against two alternative methods mostly used in the literature and\nwith the same NMF parametrisation as the one considered here. Our approach is\nrobust to initial conditions and more accurate than competing alternatives. It\nalso estimates the correct number of signatures even when other methods fail.\nResults on real data agree well with current knowledge.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: signeR is implemented in R and C++, and is\navailable as a R package at https://github.com/rvalieris/signeR CONTACT:\nitojal@cipe.accamargo.org.br SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author (2016).

Microsatellites are one of the most abundant type of variation in the\nhuman genome, after single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Indels.\nMicrosatellite analysis has a wide range of applications, including medical\ngenetics, forensics and construction of genetic genealogy. However,\nmicrosatellite variations are rarely considered in whole-genome sequencing\nstudies, in large due to a lack of tools capable of analyzing them.\nRESULTS: Here we present a microsatellite genotyper, optimized for Illumina WGS\ndata, which is both faster and more accurate than other methods previously\npresented. There are two main ingredients to our improvements. First we reduce\nthe amount of sequencing data necessary for creating microsatellite profiles by\nusing previously aligned sequencing data. Second, we use population information\nto train microsatellite and individual specific error profiles.

However, gene and protein expression profiling\nexperiments contain inherent technical variation. In discovery proteomics studies\nwhere the number of samples is typically small, technical variation plays an\nimportant role because it contributes considerably to the observed variation.\nPrevious methods place both technical and biological variations in tightly\nintegrated mathematical models that are difficult to adapt for different\ntechnological platforms.

It generates virtual data points from the observed values\naccording to a pre-defined technical distribution and subsequently employs linear\nmodeling for significance analysis. We demonstrate the flexibility of the\nproposed approach by deriving a new significance test for quantitative discovery \nproteomics for which missing values have been a major issue for traditional\nmethods such as the t-test.

They rely on a \ncombination of sampling and scoring methods, adapted to different scales.\nPolynomial Expansion of Protein Structures and Interactions for Docking\n(PEPSI-Dock) improves the accuracy of the first stage of the docking pipeline,\nwhich will sharpen up the final predictions. Indeed, PEPSI-Dock benefits from the\nprecision of a very detailed data-driven model of the binding free energy used\nwith a global and exhaustive rigid-body search space. As well as being accurate, \nour computations are among the fastest by virtue of the sparse representation of \nthe pre-computed potentials and FFT-accelerated sampling techniques. Overall,\nthis is the first demonstration of a FFT-accelerated docking method coupled with \nan arbitrary-shaped distance-dependent interaction potential.\nRESULTS: First, we present a novel learning process to compute data-driven\ndistant-dependent pairwise potentials, adapted from our previous method used for \nrescoring of putative protein-protein binding poses. The potential coefficients\nare learned by combining machine-learning techniques with physically\ninterpretable descriptors. Then, we describe the integration of the deduced\npotentials into a FFT-accelerated spherical sampling provided by the Hex library.\nOverall, on a training set of 163 heterodimers, PEPSI-Dock achieves a success\nrate of 91% mid-quality predictions in the top-10 solutions. On a subset of the\nprotein docking benchmark v5, it achieves 44.4% mid-quality predictions in the\ntop-10 solutions when starting from bound structures and 20.5% when starting from\nunbound structures. The method runs in 5-15 min on a modern laptop and can easily\nbe extended to other types of interactions.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/PEPSI-Dock\nCONTACT: sergei.grudinin@inria.fr.\n\n© The Author 2016.

In \nthis work, we use these data to study specific patterns of evolution of the viral\nproteins, and their relationship to protein interactions and immunogenicity.\nRESULTS: We propose a method for identification of two types of surface residues \nclusters with abnormal conservation: extremely conserved and extremely variable\nclusters. We identify them on the surface of proteins from HIV and other animal\nimmunodeficiency viruses. Both types of clusters are overrepresented on the\ninteraction interfaces of viral proteins with other proteins, nucleic acids or\nlow molecular-weight ligands, both in the viral particle and between the virus\nand its host. In the immunodeficiency viruses, the interaction interfaces are not\nmore conserved than the corresponding proteins on an average, and we show that\nextremely conserved clusters coincide with protein-protein interaction hotspots, \npredicted as the residues with the largest energetic contribution to the\ninteraction. Extremely variable clusters have been identified here for the first \ntime. In the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, they overlap with known antigenic\nsites. These antigenic sites also contain many residues from extremely conserved \nclusters, hence representing a unique interacting interface enriched both in\nextremely conserved and in extremely variable clusters of residues. This\nobservation may have important implication for antiretroviral vaccine\ndevelopment.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A Python package is available at\nhttps://bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/publications/viral-ppi-pred/\nCONTACT: voitenko@mpi-inf.mpg.de or kalinina@mpi-inf.mpg.de\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

For decades, it has been explored and solved using different\nexact and heuristic approaches. However, exponential growth of data in recent\nyears has brought significant challenges in improving already existing\nalgorithms. BLAST has been the most successful tool for protein database search, \nbut is also becoming a bottleneck in many applications. Due to that, many\ndifferent approaches have been developed to complement or replace it. In this\narticle, we present SWORD, an efficient protein database search implementation\nthat runs 8-16 times faster than BLAST in the sensitive mode and up to 68 times\nfaster in the fast and less accurate mode. It is designed to be used in nearly\nall database search environments, but is especially suitable for large databases.\nIts sensitivity exceeds that of BLAST for majority of input datasets and provides\nguaranteed optimal alignments.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Sword is freely available for download from\nhttps://github.com/rvaser/sword\nCONTACT: robert.vaser@fer.hr and mile.sikic@fer.hr\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

The long read length enables PacBio sequencing to \nclose gaps in genome assembly, reveal structural variations, and identify gene\nisoforms with higher accuracy in transcriptomic sequencing. However, PacBio data \nhas high sequencing error rate and most of the errors are insertion or deletion\nerrors. During alignment-based homology search, insertion or deletion errors in\ngenes will cause frameshifts and may only lead to marginal alignment scores and\nshort alignments. As a result, it is hard to distinguish true alignments from\nrandom alignments and the ambiguity will incur errors in structural and\nfunctional annotation. Existing frameshift correction tools are designed for data\nwith much lower error rate and are not optimized for PacBio data. As an\nincreasing number of groups are using SMRT, there is an urgent need for dedicated\nhomology search tools for PacBio data.\nRESULTS: In this work, we introduce Frame-Pro, a profile homology search tool for\nPacBio reads. Our tool corrects sequencing errors and also outputs the profile\nalignments of the corrected sequences against characterized protein families. We \napplied our tool to both simulated and real PacBio data. The results showed that \nour method enables more sensitive homology search, especially for PacBio data\nsets of low sequencing coverage. In addition, we can correct more errors when\ncomparing with a popular error correction tool that does not rely on hybrid\nsequencing.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is freely available at\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/frame-pro/\nCONTACT: yannisun@msu.edu.\n\n© The Author 2016.

These exciting discoveries stem\nfrom the finding of the CRISPR system being an adaptive immune system that\nprotects the prokaryotes against exogenous genetic elements such as phages.\nDespite the exciting discoveries, almost all knowledge about CRISPRs is based\nonly on microorganisms that can be isolated, cultured and sequenced in labs.\nHowever, about 95% of bacterial species cannot be cultured in labs. The fast\naccumulation of metagenomic data, which contains DNA sequences of microbial\nspecies from natural samples, provides a unique opportunity for CRISPR annotation\nin uncultivable microbial species. However, the large amount of data,\nheterogeneous coverage and shared leader sequences of some CRISPRs pose\nchallenges for identifying CRISPRs efficiently in metagenomic data.\nRESULTS: In this study, we developed a CRISPR finding tool for metagenomic data\nwithout relying on generic assembly, which is error-prone and computationally\nexpensive for complex data. Our tool can run on commonly available machines in\nsmall labs. It employs properties of CRISPRs to decompose generic assembly into\nlocal assembly.

Due to the large redundancies among genomic \nsequences of individuals from the same species, most of the medical research\ndeals with the variants in the sequences as compared with a reference sequence,\nrather than with the complete genomic sequences. Consequently, millions of\ngenomes represented as variants are stored in databases. These databases are\nconstantly updated and queried to extract information such as the common variants\namong individuals or groups of individuals. Previous algorithms for compression\nof this type of databases lack efficient random access capabilities, rendering\nquerying the database for particular variants and/or individuals extremely\ninefficient, to the point where compression is often relinquished altogether.\nRESULTS: We present a new algorithm for this task, called GTRAC, that achieves\nsignificant compression ratios while allowing fast random access over the\ncompressed database. For example, GTRAC is able to compress a Homo sapiens\ndataset containing 1092 samples in 1.1 GB (compression ratio of 160), while\nallowing for decompression of specific samples in less than a second and\ndecompression of specific variants in 17 ms.

The increasing availability of tumor related molecular data \nprovides the opportunity to identify molecular subtypes in a data-driven way.\nMolecular subtypes are defined as groups of samples that have a similar molecular\nmechanism at the origin of the carcinogenesis. The molecular mechanisms are\nreflected by subtype-specific mutational and expression features. Data-driven\nsubtyping is a complex problem as subtyping and identifying the molecular\nmechanisms that drive carcinogenesis are confounded problems. Many current\nintegrative subtyping methods use global mutational and/or expression tumor\nprofiles to group tumor samples in subtypes but do not explicitly extract the\nsubtype-specific features. We therefore present a method that solves both tasks\nof subtyping and identification of subtype-specific features simultaneously.\nHereto our method integrates` mutational and expression data while taking into\naccount the clonal properties of carcinogenesis. Key to our method is a\nformalization of the problem as a rank matrix factorization of ranked data that\napproaches the subtyping problem as multi-view bi-clustering\nRESULTS: We introduce a novel integrative framework to identify subtypes by\ncombining mutational and expression features. The incomparable measurement data\nis integrated by transformation into ranked data and subtypes are defined as\nmulti-view bi-clusters We formalize the model using rank matrix factorization,\nresulting in the SRF algorithm. Experiments on simulated data and the TCGA breast\ncancer data demonstrate that SRF is able to capture subtle differences that\nexisting methods may miss.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation is available at:\nhttps://github.com/rankmatrixfactorisation/SRF CONTACT:\nkathleen.marchal@intec.ugent.be, siegfried.nijssen@cs.kuleuven.be\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Because the simulated systems \nkeep increasing both in size and complexity, the analysis of MD trajectories need\nto be computationally efficient while being robust enough to perform analysis on \nmembranes that may be curved or deformed due to their size and/or protein-lipid\ninteractions. This work presents a new software named FATSLiM ('Fast Analysis\nToolbox for Simulations of Lipid Membranes') that can extract physical properties\nfrom MD simulations of membranes (with or without interacting proteins). Because \nit relies on the calculation of local normals, FATSLiM does not depend of the\nbilayer morphology and thus can handle with the same accuracy vesicles for\ninstance.

In the absence of reference genomes for\nmost environmental microorganisms, the use of intrinsic nucleotide patterns and\nphylogenetic anchors can improve assembly-dependent binning needed for more\naccurate taxonomic and functional annotation in communities of microorganisms,\nand assist in identifying mobile genetic elements or lateral gene transfer\nevents.\nRESULTS: Here, we present a statistic called LCA* inspired by Information and\nVoting theories that uses the NCBI Taxonomic Database hierarchy to assign\ntaxonomy to contigs assembled from environmental sequence information. The LCA*\nalgorithm identifies a sufficiently strong majority on the hierarchy while\nminimizing entropy changes to the observed taxonomic distribution resulting in\nimproved statistical properties. Moreover, we apply results from the\norder-statistic literature to formulate a likelihood-ratio hypothesis test and\nP-value for testing the supremacy of the assigned LCA* taxonomy. Using simulated \nand real-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate that voting-based methods,\nmajority vote and LCA*, in the presence of known reference annotations, are\nconsistently more accurate in identifying contig taxonomy than the lowest common \nancestor algorithm popularized by MEGAN, and that LCA* taxonomy strikes a balance\nbetween specificity and confidence to provide an estimate appropriate to the\navailable information in the data.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The LCA* has been implemented as a stand-alone\nPython library compatible with the MetaPathways pipeline; both of which are\navailable on GitHub with installation instructions and use-cases\n(http://www.github.com/hallamlab/LCAStar/).\nCONTACT: shallam@mail.ubc.caSupplementary information: Supplementary data are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Although numerous tools have been proposed to\ndetect differentially methylated single CpG site (DMC) between samples, methods\nfor direct DMR detection, especially for complex study designs, are largely\nlimited.\nRESULTS: We present a new software, GetisDMR, for direct DMR detection. We use\nbeta-binomial regression to model the whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data,\nwhere variations in methylation levels and confounding effects have been\naccounted for. We employ a region-wise test statistic, which is derived from\nlocal Getis-Ord statistics and considers the spatial correlation between nearby\nCpG sites, to detect DMRs. Unlike existing methods, that attempt to infer DMRs\nfrom DMCs based on empirical criteria, we provide statistical inference for\ndirect DMR detection. Through extensive simulations and an application to two\nmouse datasets, we demonstrate that GetisDMR achieves better sensitivities,\npositive predictive values, more exact locations and better agreement of DMRs\nwith current biological knowledge.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: It is available at\nhttps://github.com/DMU-lilab/GetisDMR CONTACTS: y.wen@auckland.ac.nz or\nzhiguangli@dlmedu.edu.cnSupplementary information: Supplementary data are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

In these settings, many classical techniques including linear\ndiscriminant analysis (LDA) falter. Poor performance of LDA is attributed to the \nill-conditioned nature of sample covariance matrix when the dimension and sample \nsize are comparable. To alleviate this problem, regularized LDA (RLDA) has been\nclassically proposed in which the sample covariance matrix is replaced by its\nridge estimate. However, the performance of RLDA depends heavily on the\nregularization parameter used in the ridge estimate of sample covariance matrix.\nRESULTS: We propose a range-search technique for efficient estimation of the\noptimum regularization parameter. Using an extensive set of simulations based on \nsynthetic and gene expression microarray data, we demonstrate the robustness of\nthe proposed technique to Gaussianity, an assumption used in developing the core \nestimator. We compare the performance of the technique in terms of accuracy and\nefficiency with classical techniques for estimating the regularization parameter.\nIn terms of accuracy, the results indicate that the proposed method vastly\nimproves on similar techniques that use classical plug-in estimator. In that\nrespect, it is better or comparable to cross-validation-based search strategies\nwhile, depending on the sample size and dimensionality, being tens to hundreds of\ntimes faster to compute.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/danik0411/optimum-rlda CONTACT:\namin.zollanvari@nu.edu.kzSupplementary information: Supplementary materials are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

The detection of functional modules in PPI\nnetworks is often performed by identifying internally densely connected\nsubnetworks, and often produces modules with \"core\" and \"peripheral\" proteins.\nThe core proteins are the ones having dense connections to each other in a\nmodule. The difference between core and peripheral proteins is important to\nunderstand the functional roles of proteins in modules, but there are few methods\nto explicitly elucidate the internal structure of functional modules at gene\nlevel.\nRESULTS: We propose NCMine, which is a novel network clustering method and\nvisualization tool for the core-peripheral structure of functional modules. It\nextracts near-complete subgraphs from networks based on a node-weighting scheme\nusing degree centrality, and reports subgroups as functional modules. We\nimplemented this method as a plugin of Cytoscape, which is widely used to\nvisualize and analyze biological networks. The plugin allows users to extract\nfunctional modules from PPI networks and interactively filter modules of\ninterest. We applied the method to human PPI networks, and found several examples\nwith the core-peripheral structure of modules that may be related to cancer\ndevelopment.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Cytoscape plugin and tutorial are available \nat Cytoscape AppStore.

The analysis of\nsuch extensive systems results in very large HDX-MS datasets for which specific\nanalysis tools are required to speed up data validation and interpretation.\nRESULTS: We introduce a web application and a new R-package named \"MEMHDX\" to\nhelp users analyze, validate and visualize large HDX-MS datasets. MEMHDX is\ncomposed of two elements. A statistical tool aids in the validation of the\nresults by applying a mixed-effects model for each peptide, in each experimental \ncondition, and at each time point, taking into account the time dependency of the\nHDX reaction and number of independent replicates. Two adjusted p-values are\ngenerated per peptide, one for the \"Change in dynamics\" and one for the\n\"Magnitude of ΔD\", and are used to classify the data by means of a \"Logit\"\nrepresentation. A user-friendly interface developed with Shiny by RStudio\nfacilitates the use of the package. This interactive tool allows the user to\neasily and rapidly validate, visualize and compare the relative deuterium\nincorporation on the amino acid sequence and 3D structure, providing both spatial\nand temporal information.\nAVAILABILITY: MEMHDX is freely available as a web tool at the project home page\nhttp://memhdx.c3bi.pasteur.fr CONTACT: marie-agnes.dillies@pasteur.fr;\nsebastien.brier@pasteur.fr SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data is\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author(s) 2016.

Molecular mechanisms that \ndrive the differentiation can be analyzed by combining mathematical modeling with\npopulation average data. For standard mathematical models, the population average\ndata is informative only if the measurements come from a homogeneous cell\nculture. In practice, however, the differentiation efficiencies are always\nimperfect. Consequently, cell cultures are inherently mixtures of several cell\ntypes, which have different molecular mechanisms and exhibit quantitatively\ndifferent dynamics. There is an urgent need for data-driven mathematical modeling\napproaches that can detect possible heterogeneity and, further, recover the\nmolecular mechanisms from heterogeneous data.\nRESULTS: We develop a novel method that models a heterogeneous population using\nhomogeneous subpopulations that evolve in parallel. Different subpopulations can \nrepresent different cell types and each subpopulation can have cell type specific\nmolecular mechanisms. We present statistical methodology that can be used to\nquantify the effect of heterogeneity and to infer the subpopulation specific\nmolecular interactions. After a proof of principle study with simulated data, we \napply our methodology to analyze the differentiation of human Th17 cells using\ntime-course RNA sequencing data. We construct putative molecular networks driving\nthe T cell activation and Th17 differentiation and allow the cell populations to \nbe split into two subpopulations in the case of heterogeneous samples. Our\nanalysis shows that the heterogeneity indeed has a statistically significant\neffect on observed dynamics and, furthermore, our statistical methodology can\ninfer both the subpopulation specific molecular mechanisms and the effect of\nheterogeneity.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An implementation of the method is available at \nhttp://research.ics.aalto.fi/csb/software/subpop/ CONTACT:\njukka.intosalmi@aalto.fi or harri.lahdesmaki@aalto.fiSupplementary information:\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

With its well-handling of \nrepeats, deBGA is substantially faster than state-of-the-art approaches while\nmaintaining similar or higher sensitivity and accuracy.

Identification of the ion-binding\nlocations is important for understanding the biological functions of proteins.\nDue to the small size and high versatility of the metal and acid radical ions,\nhowever, computational prediction of their binding sites remains difficult.\nRESULTS: We proposed a new ligand-specific approach devoted to the binding site\nprediction of 13 metal ions (Zn(2+), Cu(2+), Fe(2+), Fe(3+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+),\nMn(2+), Na(+), K(+)) and acid radical ion ligands (CO3(2-), NO2(-), SO4(2-),\nPO4(3-)) that are most frequently seen in protein databases. A sequence-based ab \ninitio model is first trained on sequence profiles, where a modified AdaBoost\nalgorithm is extended to balance binding and non-binding residue samples. A\ncomposite method IonCom is then developed to combine the ab initio model with\nmultiple threading alignments for further improving the robustness of the binding\nsite predictions. The pipeline was tested using 5-fold cross validations on a\ncomprehensive set of 2,100 non-redundant proteins bound with 3,075 small ion\nligands. Significant advantage was demonstrated compared with the state of the\nart ligand-binding methods including COACH and TargetS for high-accuracy\nion-binding site identification. Detailed data analyses show that the major\nadvantage of IonCom lies at the integration of complementary ab initio and\ntemplate-based components. Ion-specific feature design and binding library\nselection also contribute to the improvement of small ion ligand binding\npredictions.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nhttp://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/IonComSupplementary information: Supplementary\ndata are available at Bioinformatics online.\nCONTACT: hxz@imut.edu.cn or zhng@umich.edu.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Although one \nof them prevents the gene from being expressed, the other conformation allows its\nexpression, and this switching process is typically driven by the presence of a\nspecific ligand. Although there are a handful of known riboswitches, our\nknowledge in this field has been greatly limited due to our inability to identify\ntheir alternate structures from their sequences. Indeed, current methods are not \nable to predict the presence of the two functionally distinct conformations just \nfrom the knowledge of the plain RNA nucleotide sequence. Whether this would be\npossible, for which cases, and what prediction accuracy can be achieved, are\ncurrently open questions.\nRESULTS: Here we show that the two alternate secondary structures of riboswitches\ncan be accurately predicted once the 'switching sequence' of the riboswitch has\nbeen properly identified. The proposed SwiSpot approach is capable of identifying\nthe switching sequence inside a putative, complete riboswitch sequence, on the\nbasis of pairing behaviors, which are evaluated on proper sets of configurations.\nMoreover, it is able to model the switching behavior of riboswitches whose\ngenerated ensemble covers both alternate configurations.

It reduces complexity and provides a\nsystem-level view of changes in cellular activity in response to treatments\nand/or in disease states. Methods that use existing pathway network information\nhave been shown to outperform simpler methods that only take into account pathway\nmembership. However, despite significant progress in understanding the\nassociation amongst members of biological pathways, and expansion of data bases\ncontaining information about interactions of biomolecules, the existing network\ninformation may be incomplete or inaccurate and is not cell-type or disease\ncondition-specific.\nRESULTS: We propose a constrained network estimation framework that combines\nnetwork estimation based on cell- and condition-specific high-dimensional Omics\ndata with interaction information from existing data bases. The resulting pathway\ntopology information is subsequently used to provide a framework for simultaneous\ntesting of differences in expression levels of pathway members, as well as their \ninteractions. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed network\nestimator and the test for pathway enrichment, and investigate its small sample\nperformance in simulated and real data settings.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The proposed method has been implemented in the \nR-package netgsa available on CRAN.\nCONTACT: jinma@upenn.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

We introduce AutoSite: an efficient software tool for identifying\nligand-binding sites and predicting pseudo ligand corresponding to each binding\nsite identified. Binding sites are reported as clusters of 3D points called fills\nin which every point is labelled as hydrophobic or as hydrogen bond donor or\nacceptor. From these fills AutoSite derives feature points: a set of putative\npositions of hydrophobic-, and hydrogen-bond forming ligand atoms.\nRESULTS: We show that AutoSite identifies ligand-binding sites with higher\naccuracy than other leading methods, and produces fills that better matches the\nligand shape and properties, than the fills obtained with a software program with\nsimilar capabilities, AutoLigand In addition, we demonstrate that for the Astex\nDiverse Set, the feature points identify 79% of hydrophobic ligand atoms, and 81%\nand 62% of the hydrogen acceptor and donor hydrogen ligand atoms interacting with\nthe receptor, and predict 81.2% of water molecules mediating interactions between\nligand and receptor. Finally, we illustrate potential uses of the predicted\nfeature points in the context of lead optimization in drug discovery projects.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://adfr.scripps.edu/AutoDockFR/autosite.html\nCONTACT: sanner@scripps.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

SERAPHIM\nextracts the spatio-temporal information contained in estimated phylogenetic\ntrees and uses this information to calculate summary statistics of spatial spread\nand to visualize dispersal history. Most importantly, SERAPHIM enables users to\nstudy the impact of customized environmental variables on the spread of the study\norganism. Specifically, given an environmental raster, SERAPHIM computes\nenvironmental \"weights\" for each phylogeny branch, which represent the degree to \nwhich the environmental variable impedes (or facilitates) lineage movement.\nCorrelations between movement duration and these environmental weights are then\nassessed, and the statistical significances of these correlations are evaluated\nusing null distributions generated by a randomization procedure. SERAPHIM can be \napplied to any phylogeny whose nodes are annotated with spatial and temporal\ninformation. At present, such phylogenies are most often found in the field of\nemerging infectious diseases, but will become increasingly common in other\nbiological disciplines as population genomic data grows.AVAILABILITY AND\nIMPLEMENTATION: SERAPHIM 1.0 is freely available from http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/\nR package, source code, example files, tutorials and a manual are also available \nfrom this website.\nCONTACT: simon.dellicour@kuleuven.be or oliver.pybus@zoo.ox.ac.ukSupplementary\ninformation: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

(3)Department of Convergence Technology Research, Korea\nInstitute of Science and Technology Information, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.\n\nMOTIVATION: Advances in sequencing technologies have remarkably lowered the\ndetection limit of somatic variants to a low frequency. However, calling\nmutations at this range is still confounded by many factors including\nenvironmental contamination. Vector contamination is a continuously occurring\nissue and is especially problematic since vector inserts are hardly\ndistinguishable from the sample sequences. Such inserts, which may harbor\npolymorphisms and engineered functional mutations, can result in calling false\nvariants at corresponding sites. Numerous vector-screening methods have been\ndeveloped, but none could handle contamination from inserts because they are\nfocusing on vector backbone sequences alone.\nRESULTS: We developed a novel method-Vecuum-that identifies vector-originated\nreads and resultant false variants. Since vector inserts are generally\nconstructed from intron-less cDNAs, Vecuum identifies vector-originated reads by \ninspecting the clipping patterns at exon junctions. False variant calls are\nfurther detected based on the biased distribution of mutant alleles to\nvector-originated reads. Tests on simulated and spike-in experimental data\nvalidated that Vecuum could detect 93% of vector contaminants and could remove up\nto 87% of variant-like false calls with 100% precision. Application to public\nsequence datasets demonstrated the utility of Vecuum in detecting false variants \nresulting from various types of external contamination.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Java-based implementation of the method is\navailable at http://vecuum.sourceforge.net/ CONTACT: swkim@yuhs.acSupplementary\ninformation: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Owing\nto its significance for in-depth understanding various biological processes and\ndeveloping effective drugs, prediction of PTM sites in proteins have currently\nbecome a hot topic in bioinformatics. Although many computational methods were\nestablished to identify various single-label PTM types and their occurrence sites\nin proteins, no method has ever been developed for multi-label PTM types. As one \nof the most frequently observed PTMs, the K-PTM, namely, the modification\noccurring at lysine (K), can be usually accommodated with many different types,\nsuch as 'acetylation', 'crotonylation', 'methylation' and 'succinylation'. Now we\nare facing an interesting challenge: given an uncharacterized protein sequence\ncontaining many K residues, which ones can accommodate two or more types of PTM, \nwhich ones only one, and which ones none?\nRESULTS: To address this problem, a multi-label predictor called IPTM-MLYS: has\nbeen developed. It represents the first multi-label PTM predictor ever\nestablished. The novel predictor is featured by incorporating the\nsequence-coupled effects into the general PseAAC, and by fusing an array of basic\nrandom forest classifiers into an ensemble system. Rigorous cross-validations via\na set of multi-label metrics indicate that the first multi-label PTM predictor is\nvery promising and encouraging.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: For the convenience of most experimental\nscientists, a user-friendly web-server for iPTM-mLys has been established at\nhttp://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iPTM-mLys, by which users can easily obtain their\ndesired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical\nequations involved.\nCONTACT: wqiu@gordonlifescience.org, xxiao@gordonlifescience.org,\nkcchou@gordonlifescience.orgSupplementary information: Supplementary data are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Curie, Paris, France.\n\nMOTIVATION: Graphical models are often employed to interpret patterns of\ncorrelations observed in data through a network of interactions between the\nvariables. Recently, Ising/Potts models, also known as Markov random fields, have\nbeen productively applied to diverse problems in biology, including the\nprediction of structural contacts from protein sequence data and the description \nof neural activity patterns. However, inference of such models is a challenging\ncomputational problem that cannot be solved exactly. Here, we describe the\nadaptive cluster expansion (ACE) method to quickly and accurately infer Ising or \nPotts models based on correlation data. ACE avoids overfitting by constructing a \nsparse network of interactions sufficient to reproduce the observed correlation\ndata within the statistical error expected due to finite sampling. When\nconvergence of the ACE algorithm is slow, we combine it with a Boltzmann Machine \nLearning algorithm (BML). We illustrate this method on a variety of biological\nand artificial datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art approximate methods\nsuch as Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood inference.\nRESULTS: We show that ACE accurately reproduces the true parameters of the\nunderlying model when they are known, and yields accurate statistical\ndescriptions of both biological and artificial data. Models inferred by ACE more \naccurately describe the statistics of the data, including both the constrained\nlow-order correlations and unconstrained higher-order correlations, compared to\nthose obtained by faster Gaussian and pseudo-likelihood methods. These\nalternative approaches can recover the structure of the interaction network but\ntypically not the correct strength of interactions, resulting in less accurate\ngenerative models.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The ACE source code, user manual and tutorials\nwith the example data and filtered correlations described herein are freely\navailable on GitHub at https://github.com/johnbarton/ACE CONTACTS:\njpbarton@mit.edu, cocco@lps.ens.frSupplementary information: Supplementary data\nare available at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

(2)Department of Viroscience, Rotterdam, Erasmus MC, 3000CA, the\nNetherlands.\n\nMOTIVATION: High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) has enabled researchers to probe the\nhuman T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, which consists of many rare sequences.\nDistinguishing between true but rare TCR sequences and variants generated by\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing errors remains a formidable\nchallenge. The conventional approach to handle errors is to remove low quality\nreads, and/or rare TCR sequences. Such filtering discards a large number of true \nand often rare TCR sequences. However, accurate identification and quantification\nof rare TCR sequences is essential for repertoire diversity estimation.\nRESULTS: We devised a pipeline, called Recover TCR (RTCR), that accurately\nrecovers TCR sequences, including rare TCR sequences, from HTS data (including\nbarcoded data) even at low coverage. RTCR employs a data-driven statistical model\nto rectify PCR and sequencing errors in an adaptive manner. Using simulations, we\ndemonstrate that RTCR can easily adapt to the error profiles of different types\nof sequencers and exhibits consistently high recall and high precision even at\nlow coverages where other pipelines perform poorly. Using published real data, we\nshow that RTCR accurately resolves sequencing errors and outperforms all other\npipelines.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The RTCR pipeline is implemented in Python\n(v2.7) and C and is freely available at http://uubram.github.io/RTCR/along with\ndocumentation and examples of typical usage.\nCONTACT: b.gerritsen@uu.nl.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Euclid Ave, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.\n\nMOTIVATION: Uridine diphosphate glucunosyltransferases (UGTs) metabolize 15% of\nFDA approved drugs. Lead optimization efforts benefit from knowing how candidate \ndrugs are metabolized by UGTs. This paper describes a computational method for\npredicting sites of UGT-mediated metabolism on drug-like molecules.\nRESULTS: XenoSite correctly predicts test molecule's sites of glucoronidation in \nthe Top-1 or Top-2 predictions at a rate of 86 and 97%, respectively. In addition\nto predicting common sites of UGT conjugation, like hydroxyl groups, it can also \naccurately predict the glucoronidation of atypical sites, such as carbons. We\nalso describe a simple heuristic model for predicting UGT-mediated sites of\nmetabolism that performs nearly as well (with, respectively, 80 and 91% Top-1 and\nTop-2 accuracy), and can identify the most challenging molecules to predict on\nwhich to assess more complex models. Compared with prior studies, this model is\nmore generally applicable, more accurate and simpler (not requiring expensive\nquantum modeling).\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The UGT metabolism predictor developed in this\nstudy is available at http://swami.wustl.edu/xenosite/p/ugt CONTACT: :\nswamidass@wustl.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at\nBioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Modern high-throughput technologies allow\nthe measurement of concentrations of transcripts, metabolites and other species\nalong the circadian cycle creating novel computational challenges and\nopportunities, including the problems of inferring whether a given species\noscillate in circadian fashion or not, and inferring the time at which a set of\nmeasurements was taken.\nRESULTS: We first curate several large synthetic and biological time series\ndatasets containing labels for both periodic and aperiodic signals. We then use\ndeep learning methods to develop and train BIO_CYCLE, a system to robustly\nestimate which signals are periodic in high-throughput circadian experiments,\nproducing estimates of amplitudes, periods, phases, as well as several\nstatistical significance measures. Using the curated data, BIO_CYCLE is compared \nto other approaches and shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance across\nmultiple metrics. We then use deep learning methods to develop and train\nBIO_CLOCK to robustly estimate the time at which a particular single-time-point\ntranscriptomic experiment was carried.

A recent sequencing technology, known as Methylated RNA\nImmunoprecipitation Sequencing technology (MeRIP-seq), has been developed for\ntranscriptome-wide profiling of m(6)A. We previously developed a peak calling\nalgorithm called exomePeak. However, exomePeak over-simplifies data\ncharacteristics and ignores the reads' variances among replicates or reads\ndependency across a site region. To further improve the performance, new model is\nneeded to address these important issues of MeRIP-seq data.\nRESULTS: We propose a novel, graphical model-based peak calling method, MeTPeak, \nfor transcriptome-wide detection of m(6)A sites from MeRIP-seq data. MeTPeak\nexplicitly models read count of an m(6)A site and introduces a hierarchical layer\nof Beta variables to capture the variances and a Hidden Markov model to\ncharacterize the reads dependency across a site. In addition, we developed a\nconstrained Newton's method and designed a log-barrier function to compute\nanalytically intractable, positively constrained Beta parameters. We applied our \nalgorithm to simulated and real biological datasets and demonstrated significant \nimprovement in detection performance and robustness over exomePeak. Prediction\nresults on publicly available MeRIP-seq datasets are also validated and shown to \nbe able to recapitulate the known patterns of m(6)A, further validating the\nimproved performance of MeTPeak.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The package 'MeTPeak' is implemented in R and\nC ++, and additional details are available at\nhttps://github.com/compgenomics/MeTPeak\nCONTACT: yufei.huang@utsa.edu or xdchoi@gmail.com\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Often involved in the regulation of\nheat shock, cold shock and virulence genes, RNATs constitute an interesting\npotential resource in synthetic biology, where engineered RNATs could prove to be\nuseful tools in biosensors and conditional gene regulation.\nRESULTS: Solving the 2-temperature inverse folding problem is critical for RNAT\nengineering. Here we introduce RNAiFold2T, the first Constraint Programming (CP) \nand Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithms to solve this problem.\nBenchmarking tests of RNAiFold2T against existent programs (adaptive walk and\ngenetic algorithm) inverse folding show that our software generates two orders of\nmagnitude more solutions, thus allowing ample exploration of the space of\nsolutions. Subsequently, solutions can be prioritized by computing various\nmeasures, including probability of target structure in the ensemble, melting\ntemperature, etc. Using this strategy, we rationally designed two thermosensor\ninternal ribosome entry site (thermo-IRES) elements, whose normalized\ncap-independent translation efficiency is approximately 50% greater at 42 °C than\n30 °C, when tested in reticulocyte lysates. Translation efficiency is lower than \nthat of the wild-type IRES element, which on the other hand is fully resistant to\ntemperature shift-up. This appears to be the first purely computational design of\nfunctional RNA thermoswitches, and certainly the first purely computational\ndesign of functional thermo-IRES elements.\nAVAILABILITY: RNAiFold2T is publicly available as part of the new release\nRNAiFold3.0 at https://github.com/clotelab/RNAiFold and\nhttp://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNAiFold, which latter has a web server as \nwell.

They are different from flexible linkers/residues\nbecause they are disordered and longer. Availability of experimentally annotated \nDFLs provides an opportunity to build high-throughput computational predictors of\nthese regions from protein sequences. To date, there are no computational methods\nthat directly predict DFLs and they can be found only indirectly by filtering\npredicted flexible residues with predictions of disorder.\nRESULTS: We conceptualized, developed and empirically assessed a\nfirst-of-its-kind sequence-based predictor of DFLs, DFLpred. This method outputs \npropensity to form DFLs for each residue in the input sequence. DFLpred uses a\nsmall set of empirically selected features that quantify propensities to form\ncertain secondary structures, disordered regions and structured regions, which\nare processed by a fast linear model. Our high-throughput predictor can be used\non the whole-proteome scale; it needs <1 h to predict entire proteome on a single\nCPU. When assessed on an independent test dataset with low sequence-identity\nproteins, it secures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal\n0.715 and outperforms existing alternatives that include methods for the\nprediction of flexible linkers, flexible residues, intrinsically disordered\nresidues and various combinations of these methods. Prediction on the complete\nhuman proteome reveals that about 10% of proteins have a large content of over\n30% DFL residues.

Despite the advances in recent decades on\nsequence alignment, threading and alignment-free methods, protein homology\ndetection remains a challenging open problem. Recently, network methods that try \nto find transitive paths in the protein structure space demonstrate the\nimportance of incorporating network information of the structure space. Yet,\ncurrent methods merge the sequence space and the structure space into a single\nspace, and thus introduce inconsistency in combining different sources of\ninformation.\nMETHOD: We present a novel network-based protein homology detection method,\nCMsearch, based on cross-modal learning. Instead of exploring a single network\nbuilt from the mixture of sequence and structure space information, CMsearch\nbuilds two separate networks to represent the sequence space and the structure\nspace. It then learns sequence-structure correlation by simultaneously taking\nsequence information, structure information, sequence space information and\nstructure space information into consideration.\nRESULTS: We tested CMsearch on two challenging tasks, protein homology detection \nand protein structure prediction, by querying all 8332 PDB40 proteins. Our\nresults demonstrate that CMsearch is insensitive to the similarity metrics used\nto define the sequence and the structure spaces. By using HMM-HMM alignment as\nthe sequence similarity metric, CMsearch clearly outperforms state-of-the-art\nhomology detection methods and the CASP-winning template-based protein structure \nprediction methods.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our program is freely available for download\nfrom http://sfb.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Software.aspx\nCONTACT: : xin.gao@kaust.edu.sa\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Structure comparison is important \nparticularly for evaluating computational protein structure models. Most of the\nmodel structure evaluation methods perform rigid body superimposition of a\nstructure model to its crystal structure and measure the difference of the\ncorresponding residue or atom positions between them. However, these methods\nneglect intrinsic flexibility of proteins by treating the native structure as a\nrigid molecule. Because different parts of proteins have different levels of\nflexibility, for example, exposed loop regions are usually more flexible than the\ncore region of a protein structure, disagreement of a model to the native needs\nto be evaluated differently depending on the flexibility of residues in a\nprotein.\nRESULTS: We propose a score named FlexScore for comparing protein structures that\nconsider flexibility of each residue in the native state of proteins. Flexibility\ninformation may be extracted from experiments such as NMR or molecular dynamics\nsimulation. FlexScore considers an ensemble of conformations of a protein\ndescribed as a multivariate Gaussian distribution of atomic displacements and\ncompares a query computational model with the ensemble. We compare FlexScore with\nother commonly used structure similarity scores over various examples. FlexScore \nagrees with experts' intuitive assessment of computational models and provides\ninformation of practical usefulness of models.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://bitbucket.org/mjamroz/flexscore\nCONTACT: dkihara@purdue.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Genes, however, can exhibit varying\nlevels of cell type specificity in their expression, and their coordinated\nexpression manifests in tissue-specific function and pathology.\nTissue-specific/tissue-selective interaction mechanisms have significant\napplications in drug discovery, as they are more likely to reveal drug targets.\nFurthermore, tissue-specific transcription factors (tsTFs) are significantly\nimplicated in human disease, including cancers. Finally, disease genes and\nprotein complexes have the tendency to be differentially expressed in tissues in \nwhich defects cause pathology. These observations motivate the construction of\nrefined tissue-specific interactomes from organism-specific interactomes.\nRESULTS: We present a novel technique for constructing human tissue-specific\ninteractomes. Using a variety of validation tests (Edge Set Enrichment Analysis, \nGene Ontology Enrichment, Disease-Gene Subnetwork Compactness), we show that our \nproposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. Finally,\nusing case studies of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, we show that\ntissue-specific interactomes derived from our study can be used to construct\npathways implicated in pathology and demonstrate the use of these pathways in\nidentifying novel targets.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nhttp://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/mohammas/projects/ActPro.html\nCONTACT: mohammadi@purdue.edu.\n\n© The Author 2016.

O- and N-glycans, which are post-translationally\nattached to proteins and lipids, are sugar chains that are rooted, tree\nstructures. Independent efforts to develop computational tools for analyzing\ncomplex carbohydrate structures have been designed to exploit specific databases \nrequiring unique formatting and limited transferability. Attempts have been made \nat integrating these resources, yet it remains difficult to communicate and share\ndata across several online resources. A disadvantage of the lack of coordination \nbetween development efforts is the inability of the user community to create\nreproducible analyses (workflows). The latter results in the more serious\nunreliability of glycomics metadata.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we realize the significance of connecting multiple online\nglycan resources that can be used to design reproducible experiments for\nobtaining, generating and analyzing cell glycomes. To address this, a suite of\ntools and utilities, have been integrated into the analytic functionality of the \nGalaxy bioinformatics platform to provide a Glycome Analytics Platform\n(GAP).Using this platform, users can design in silico workflows to manipulate\nvarious formats of glycan sequences and analyze glycomes through access to web\ndata and services. We illustrate the central functionality and features of the\nGAP by way of example; we analyze and compare the features of the N-glycan\nglycome of monocytic cells sourced from two separate data depositions.This paper \nhighlights the use of reproducible research methods for glycomics analysis and\nthe GAP presents an opportunity for integrating tools in glycobioinformatics.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: This software is open-source and available\nonline at https://bitbucket.org/scientificomputing/glycome-analytics-platform\nCONTACTS: chris.barnett@uct.ac.za or kevin.naidoo@uct.ac.za\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Existing tools utilize functional genomics\ndata and evolutionary information to evaluate the pathogenicity or regulatory\nfunctions of non-coding variants. However, different algorithms lead to\ninconsistent and even conflicting predictions. Combining multiple methods may\nincrease accuracy in regulatory variant prediction.\nRESULTS: Here, we compiled an integrative resource for predictions from eight\ndifferent tools on functional annotation of non-coding variants. We further\ndeveloped a composite strategy to integrate multiple predictions and computed the\ncomposite likelihood of a given variant being regulatory variant. Benchmarked by \nmultiple independent causal variants datasets, we demonstrated that our composite\nmodel significantly improves the prediction performance.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We implemented our model and scoring procedure\nas a tool, named PRVCS, which is freely available to academic and non-profit\nusage at http://jjwanglab.org/PRVCS CONTACT: wang.junwen@mayo.edu,\njliu@stat.harvard.edu, or limx54@gmail.com\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Joint and individual variation explained (JIVE) is a tool for\nexploratory dimension reduction that decomposes a multi-source dataset into three\nterms: a low-rank approximation capturing joint variation across sources,\nlow-rank approximations for structured variation individual to each source and\nresidual noise. JIVE has been used to explore multi-source data for a variety of \napplication areas but its accessibility was previously limited. We introduce\nR.JIVE, an intuitive R package to perform JIVE and visualize the results. We\ndiscuss several improvements and extensions of the JIVE methodology that are\nincluded. We illustrate the package with an application to multi-source breast\ntumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R.JIVE\nis available via the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) under the GPLv3\nlicense: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/r.jive/\nCONTACT: elock@umn.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

However, analysis\nof metagenomic composition is often complicated by the high complexity of the\ncommunity and the lack of related reference genomic sequences. As a start point\nfor comparative metagenomic analysis, the researchers require efficient means for\nassessing pairwise similarity of the metagenomes (beta-diversity). A number of\napproaches were used to address this task, however, most of them have inherent\ndisadvantages that limit their scope of applicability. For instance, the\nreference-based methods poorly perform on metagenomes from previously unstudied\nniches, while composition-based methods appear to be too abstract for\nstraightforward interpretation and do not allow to identify the differentially\nabundant features.\nRESULTS: We developed MetaFast, an approach that allows to represent a shotgun\nmetagenome from an arbitrary environment as a modified de Bruijn graph consisting\nof simplified components. For multiple metagenomes, the resulting representation \nis used to obtain a pairwise similarity matrix. The dimensional structure of the \nmetagenomic components preserved in our algorithm reflects the inherent\nsubspecies-level diversity of microbiota. The method is computationally efficient\nand especially promising for an analysis of metagenomes from novel environmental \nniches.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and binaries are freely available\nfor download at https://github.com/ctlab/metafast The code is written in Java and\nis platform independent (tested on Linux and Windows x86_64).\nCONTACT: ulyantsev@rain.ifmo.ru\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

However, integrative analysis of these data sets is\ndifficult due to prevailing ambiguity between chemical names and identifiers and \na lack of cross-references between databases.\nRESULTS: To address this challenge, we have developed CART, a Chemical Annotation\nRetrieval Toolkit.

In this unified space, bioactivity annotations can be easily\nretrieved from databases covering a wide variety of chemical effects on\nbiological systems. Subsequently, CART can determine annotations enriched in the \ninput set of chemicals and display these in tabular format and interactive\nnetwork visualizations, thereby facilitating integrative analysis of chemical\nbioactivity data.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CART is available as a Galaxy web service\n(cart.embl.de).

Several previous variant\npathogenicity prediction methods have been proposed that quantify evolutionary\nconservation among homologous proteins from different organisms. PANTHER-PSEP\nemploys a related but distinct metric based on 'evolutionary preservation':\nhomologous proteins are used to reconstruct the likely sequences of ancestral\nproteins at nodes in a phylogenetic tree, and the history of each amino acid can \nbe traced back in time from its current state to estimate how long that state has\nbeen preserved in its ancestors. Here, we describe the PSEP tool, and assess its \nperformance on standard benchmarks for distinguishing disease-associated from\nneutral variation in humans. On these benchmarks, PSEP outperforms not only\nprevious tools that utilize evolutionary conservation, but also several highly\nused tools that include multiple other sources of information as well. For\npredicting pathogenic human variants, the trace back of course starts with a\nhuman 'reference' protein sequence, but the PSEP tool can also be applied to\npredicting deleterious or pathogenic variants in reference proteins from any of\nthe ∼100 other species in the PANTHER database.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:\nPANTHER-PSEP is freely available on the web at\nhttp://pantherdb.org/tools/csnpScoreForm.jsp Users can also download the\ncommand-line based tool at ftp://ftp.pantherdb.org/cSNP_analysis/PSEP/ CONTACT:\npdthomas@usc.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Nowadays new generation vaccines based on\nsubunit antigens reduce adverse effects in high risk individuals. However,\nvaccine antigens are often poor immunogens when administered alone. Adjuvants\nrepresent a good strategy to overcome such hurdles, indeed they are able to:\nenhance the immune response; allow antigens sparing; accelerate the specific\nimmune response; and increase vaccine efficacy in vulnerable groups such as\nnewborns, elderly or immuno-compromised people. However, due to safety concerns\nand adverse reactions, there are only a few adjuvants approved for use in humans.\nMoreover, in practice current adjuvants sometimes fail to confer adequate\nstimulation. Hence, there is an imperative need to develop novel adjuvants that\novercome the limitations of the currently available licensed adjuvants.\nRESULTS: We developed a computational framework that provides a complete pipeline\ncapable of predicting the best citrus-derived adjuvants for enhancing the immune \nsystem response using, as a target disease model, influenza A infection. In\nsilico simulations suggested a good immune efficacy of specific citrus-derived\nadjuvant (Beta Sitosterol) that was then confirmed in vivoAvailability: The model\nis available visiting the following URL: http://vaima.dmi.unict.it/AdjSim\nCONTACT: francesco.pappalardo@unict.it; fp@francescopappalardo.net.\n\n© The Author 2016.

In this work, we assessed how existing hybrid\nand non-hybrid de novo assembly methods perform on long and error prone nanopore \nreads.\nRESULTS: We benchmarked five non-hybrid (in terms of both error correction and\nscaffolding) assembly pipelines as well as two hybrid assemblers which use third \ngeneration sequencing data to scaffold Illumina assemblies. Tests were performed \non several publicly available MinION and Illumina datasets of Escherichia coli\nK-12, using several sequencing coverages of nanopore data (20×, 30×, 40× and\n50×). We attempted to assess the assembly quality at each of these coverages, in \norder to estimate the requirements for closed bacterial genome assembly. For the \npurpose of the benchmark, an extensible genome assembly benchmarking framework\nwas developed. Results show that hybrid methods are highly dependent on the\nquality of NGS data, but much less on the quality and coverage of nanopore data\nand perform relatively well on lower nanopore coverages. All non-hybrid methods\ncorrectly assemble the E. coli genome when coverage is above 40×, even the\nnon-hybrid method tailored for Pacific Biosciences reads. While it requires\nhigher coverage compared to a method designed particularly for nanopore reads,\nits running time is significantly lower.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/kkrizanovic/NanoMark\nCONTACT: mile.sikic@fer.hr\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Gene-level association tests are often performed to analyze rare \nvariants, where multiple rare variants in a gene region are analyzed jointly.\nApplying gene-level association tests to analyze sequence data often requires\nintegrating multiple heterogeneous sources of information (e.g. annotations,\nfunctional prediction scores, allele frequencies, genotypes and phenotypes) to\ndetermine the optimal analysis unit and prioritize causal variants. Given the\ncomplexity and scale of current sequence datasets and bioinformatics databases,\nthere is a compelling need for more efficient software tools to facilitate these \nanalyses. To answer this challenge, we developed RVTESTS, which implements a\nbroad set of rare variant association statistics and supports the analysis of\nautosomal and X-linked variants for both unrelated and related individuals.\nRVTESTS also provides useful companion features for annotating sequence variants,\nintegrating bioinformatics databases, performing data quality control and sample \nselection. We illustrate the advantages of RVTESTS in functionality and\nefficiency using the 1000 Genomes Project data.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: RVTESTS is available on Linux, MacOS and\nWindows.

We consider the case where a\nuser searches for genetic information (e.g. an allele) on a server that stores a \nlarge genomic database and aims to receive allele-associated information. The\nuser would like to keep the query and result private and the server the database.\nAPPROACH: We propose a novel approach that combines efficient string data\nstructures such as the Burrows-Wheeler transform with cryptographic techniques\nbased on additive homomorphic encryption. We assume that the sequence data is\nsearchable in efficient iterative query operations over a large indexed\ndictionary, for instance, from large genome collections and employing the\n(positional) Burrows-Wheeler transform. We use a technique called oblivious\ntransfer that is based on additive homomorphic encryption to conceal the sequence\nquery and the genomic region of interest in positional queries.\nRESULTS: We designed and implemented an efficient algorithm for searching\nsequences of SNPs in large genome databases. During search, the user can only\nidentify the longest match while the server does not learn which sequence of SNPs\nthe user queried. In an experiment based on 2184 aligned haploid genomes from the\n1000 Genomes Project, our algorithm was able to perform typical queries within\n[Formula: see text] 4.6 s and [Formula: see text] 10.8 s for client and server\nside, respectively, on laptop computers. The presented algorithm is at least one \norder of magnitude faster than an exhaustive baseline algorithm.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/iskana/PBWT-sec and\nhttps://github.com/ratschlab/PBWT-sec\nCONTACTS: shimizu-kana@aist.go.jp or Gunnar.Ratsch@ratschlab.org\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Synthesis of effects from multiple surrounding\nfunctional variants has been suggested as an explanation of hard-to-interpret\nfindings. We define filter criteria based on linkage disequilibrium measures and \nallele frequencies which reflect expected properties of synthesizing variant\nsets. For eligible candidate sets, we search for haplotype markers that are\nhighly correlated with associated variants.\nRESULTS: Via simulations we assess the performance of our approach and suggest\nparameter settings which guarantee 95% sensitivity at 20-fold reduced\ncomputational cost. We apply our method to 1000 Genomes data and confirmed\nCrohn's Disease (CD) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) variants. A proportion of 36.9%\nallowed explanation by three-variant-haplotypes carrying at least two functional \nvariants, as compared to 16.4% for random variants ([Formula: see text]).\nAssociation could be explained by missense variants for MUC19, PER3 (CD) and\nHMG20A (T2D). In a CD GWAS-imputed using haplotype reference consortium data (64 \n976 haplotypes)-we could confirm the syntheses of MUC19 and PER3 and identified\nsynthesis by missense variants for 6 further genes (ZGPAZ, GPR65, CLN3/NPIPB8,\nLOC102723878, rs2872507, GCKR). In all instances, the odds ratios of the\nsynthesizing haplotypes were virtually identical to that of the index SNP.

Most of these predictors focus on SNVs and use a combination of features\nrelated to sequence conservation, biophysical, and/or structural properties to\nlink the observed variant to either neutral or disease phenotype. Despite notable\nsuccesses, the mapping between genetic variants and their phenotypic effects is\nriddled with levels of complexity that are not yet fully understood and that are \noften not taken into account in the predictions, despite their promise of\nsignificantly improving the prediction of deleterious mutants.\nRESULTS: We present DEOGEN, a novel variant effect predictor that can handle both\nmissense SNVs and in-frame INDELs. By integrating information from different\nbiological scales and mimicking the complex mixture of effects that lead from the\nvariant to the phenotype, we obtain significant improvements in the\nvariant-effect prediction results. Next to the typical variant-oriented features \nbased on the evolutionary conservation of the mutated positions, we added a\ncollection of protein-oriented features that are based on functional aspects of\nthe gene affected. We cross-validated DEOGEN on 36 825 polymorphisms, 20 821\ndeleterious SNVs, and 1038 INDELs from SwissProt. The multilevel\ncontextualization of each (variant, protein) pair in DEOGEN provides a 10%\nimprovement of MCC with respect to current state-of-the-art tools.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software and the data presented here is\npublicly available at http://ibsquare.be/deogen\nCONTACT: : wvranken@vub.ac.be\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Such dynamics of phase transition is generally \ncomposed of three stages, i.e. before-transition state, pre-transition state and \nafter-transition state, which can be considered as three different Markov\nprocesses.\nRESULTS: By exploring the rich dynamical information provided by high-throughput \ndata, we present a novel computational method, i.e. hidden Markov model (HMM)\nbased approach, to detect the switching point of the two Markov processes from\nthe before-transition state (a stationary Markov process) to the pre-transition\nstate (a time-varying Markov process), thereby identifying the pre-transition\nstate or early-warning signals of the phase transition. To validate the\neffectiveness, we apply this method to detect the signals of the imminent phase\ntransitions of complex systems based on the simulated datasets, and further\nidentify the pre-transition states as well as their critical modules for three\nreal datasets, i.e. the acute lung injury triggered by phosgene inhalation, MCF-7\nhuman breast cancer caused by heregulin and HCV-induced dysplasia and\nhepatocellular carcinoma.

Bond Life Science Center, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO\n65211, USA.\n\nMOTIVATION: Speed, accuracy and robustness of building protein fragment library\nhave important implications in de novo protein structure prediction since\nfragment-based methods are one of the most successful approaches in template-free\nmodeling (FM). Majority of the existing fragment detection methods rely on\ndatabase-driven search strategies to identify candidate fragments, which are\ninherently time-consuming and often hinder the possibility to locate longer\nfragments due to the limited sizes of databases. Also, it is difficult to\nalleviate the effect of noisy sequence-based predicted features such as secondary\nstructures on the quality of fragment.\nRESULTS: Here, we present FRAGSION, a database-free method to efficiently\ngenerate protein fragment library by sampling from an Input-Output Hidden Markov \nModel. FRAGSION offers some unique features compared to existing approaches in\nthat it (i) is lightning-fast, consuming only few seconds of CPU time to generate\nfragment library for a protein of typical length (300 residues); (ii) can\ngenerate dynamic-size fragments of any length (even for the whole protein\nsequence) and (iii) offers ways to handle noise in predicted secondary structure \nduring fragment sampling. On a FM dataset from the most recent Critical\nAssessment of Structure Prediction, we demonstrate that FGRAGSION provides\nadvantages over the state-of-the-art fragment picking protocol of ROSETTA suite\nby speeding up computation by several orders of magnitude while achieving\ncomparable performance in fragment quality.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and executable versions of FRAGSION \nfor Linux and MacOS is freely available to non-commercial users at\nhttp://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/FRAGSION/ It is bundled with a manual and example\ndata.\nCONTACT: chengji@missouri.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Hybrid modeling is often\napplied to integrate high-resolution models into SAXS data analysis. To\nfacilitate this task, we present SASpy, a PyMOL plugin that provides an\neasy-to-use graphical interface for SAXS-based hybrid modeling. Through a few\nmouse clicks in SASpy, low-resolution models can be superimposed to\nhigh-resolution structures, theoretical scattering profiles and fits can be\ncalculated and displayed on-the-fly. Mouse-based manual rearrangements of\ncomplexes are conveniently applied to rapidly check and interactively refine\ntentative models. Interfaces to automated rigid-body and flexible refinement of\nmacromolecular models against the experimental SAXS data are\nprovided.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SASpy is available as open source at:\ngithub.com/emblsaxs/saspy/.

How to perform a joint analysis\nof these data to gain new biological insights has become a critical step in\nunderstanding the etiology of complex diseases. Due to the polygenic architecture\nof complex diseases, the identification of risk genes remains challenging.\nMotivated by the shared risk genes found in complex diseases and tissue-specific \ngene expression patterns, we propose as an Empirical Bayes approach to\nintegrating Pleiotropy and Tissue-Specific information (EPS) for prioritizing\nrisk genes.\nRESULTS: As demonstrated by extensive simulation studies, EPS greatly improves\nthe power of identification for disease-risk genes.

All of the model parameters can be adaptively estimated from the\ndeveloped expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

A\nfundamental challenge is to site such data in repositories that can easily be\naccessed under appropriate technical and governance controls which are\neffectively audited and are viewed as trustworthy by diverse stakeholders. This\ndemands socio-technical solutions that may easily become enmeshed in protracted\ndebate and controversy as they encounter the norms, values, expectations and\nconcerns of diverse stakeholders. In this context, the development of what are\ncalled 'Data Safe Havens' has been crucial. Unfortunately, the origins and\nevolution of the term have led to a range of different definitions being assumed \nby different groups. There is, however, an intuitively meaningful interpretation \nthat is often assumed by those who have not previously encountered the term: a\nrepository in which useful but potentially sensitive data may be kept securely\nunder governance and informatics systems that are fit-for-purpose and\nappropriately tailored to the nature of the data being maintained, and may be\naccessed and utilized by legitimate users undertaking work and research\ncontributing to biomedicine, health and/or to ongoing development of healthcare\nsystems.\nRESULTS: This review explores a fundamental question: 'what are the specific\ncriteria that ought reasonably to be met by a data repository if it is to be seen\nas consistent with this interpretation and viewed as worthy of being accorded the\nstatus of 'Data Safe Haven' by key stakeholders'? We propose 12 such criteria.\nCONTACT: paul.burton@bristol.ac.uk.\n\n© The Author 2015.

They have a long empirical history of treating\ndiseases with relatively few side effects. Based on these strengths, many studies\nhave been performed to verify the effectiveness of plants in treating diseases.\nIt is crucial to understand the chemicals contained in plants because these\nchemicals can regulate activities of proteins that are key factors in causing\ndiseases. With the accumulation of a large volume of biomedical literature in\nvarious databases such as PubMed, it is possible to automatically extract\nrelationships between plants and chemicals in a large-scale way if we apply a\ntext mining approach. A cornerstone of achieving this task is a corpus of\nrelationships between plants and chemicals.\nRESULTS: In this study, we first constructed a corpus for plant and chemical\nentities and for the relationships between them. The corpus contains 267 plant\nentities, 475 chemical entities, and 1,007 plant-chemical relationships (550 and \n457 positive and negative relationships, respectively), which are drawn from 377 \nsentences in 245 PubMed abstracts. Inter-annotator agreement scores for the\ncorpus among three annotators were measured. The simple percent agreement scores \nfor entities and trigger words for the relationships were 99.6 and 94.8 %,\nrespectively, and the overall kappa score for the classification of positive and \nnegative relationships was 79.8 %. We also developed a rule-based model to\nautomatically extract such plant-chemical relationships. When we evaluated the\nrule-based model using the corpus and randomly selected biomedical articles,\noverall F-scores of 68.0 and 61.8 % were achieved, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: We expect that the corpus for plant-chemical relationships will be a \nuseful resource for enhancing plant research. The corpus is available at\nhttp://combio.gist.ac.kr/plantchemicalcorpus .\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1249-5 \nPMCID: PMC5029005\nPMID: 27650402  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Despite advances in recent methods conducted on large \ndatasets, the estimated upper limit accuracy is yet to be reached. Since the\npredictions of SSP methods are applied as input to higher-level structure\nprediction pipelines, even small errors may have large perturbations in final\nmodels. Previous works relied on cross validation as an estimate of classifier\naccuracy. However, training on large numbers of protein chains compromises the\nclassifier ability to generalize to new sequences. This prompts a novel approach \nto training and an investigation into the possible structural factors that lead\nto poor predictions. Here, a small group of 55 proteins termed the compact model \nis selected from the CB513 dataset using a heuristics-based approach. In a prior \nwork, all sequences were represented as probability matrices of residues adopting\neach of Helix, Sheet and Coil states, based on energy calculations using the\nC-Alpha, C-Beta, Side-chain (CABS) algorithm. The functional relationship between\nthe conformational energies computed with CABS force-field and residue states is \napproximated using a classifier termed the Fully Complex-valued Relaxation\nNetwork (FCRN). The FCRN is trained with the compact model proteins.\nRESULTS: The performance of the compact model is compared with traditional\ncross-validated accuracies and blind-tested on a dataset of G Switch proteins,\nobtaining accuracies of ∼81 %. The model demonstrates better results when\ncompared to several techniques in the literature. A comparative case study of the\nworst performing chain identifies hydrogen bond contacts that lead to Coil ⇔\nSheet misclassifications. Overall, mispredicted Coil residues have a higher\npropensity to participate in backbone hydrogen bonding than correctly predicted\nCoils.\nCONCLUSIONS: The implications of these findings are: (i) the choice of training\nproteins is important in preserving the generalization of a classifier to predict\nnew sequences accurately and (ii) SSP techniques sensitive in distinguishing\nbetween backbone hydrogen bonding and side-chain or water-mediated hydrogen\nbonding might be needed in the reduction of Coil ⇔ Sheet misclassifications.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1209-0 \nPMCID: PMC5020447\nPMID: 27618812  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Several methods have been proposed to transfer regulatory information\nbetween bacterial species, but the paucity and distributed nature of experimental\ninformation on bacterial transcriptional networks have prevented their systematic\nevaluation.\nRESULTS: We report the compilation of a large catalog of transcription\nfactor-binding sites across Bacteria and its use to systematically benchmark\nproposed transfer methods across pairs of bacterial species. We evaluate motif-\nand accuracy-based metrics to assess the results of regulatory network transfer\nand we identify the precision-recall area-under-the-curve as the best metric for \nthis purpose due to the large class-imbalanced nature of the problem. Methods\nassuming conservation of the transcription factor-binding motif (motif-based) are\nshown to substantially outperform those assuming conservation of regulon\ncomposition (network-based), even though their efficiency can decrease sharply\nwith increasing phylogenetic distance. Variations of the basic motif-based\ntransfer method do not yield significant improvements in transfer accuracy. Our\nresults indicate that detection of a large enough number of regulated orthologs\nis critical for network-based transfer methods, but that relaxing orthology\nrequirements does not improve results. Using the transcriptional regulators LexA \nand Fur as case examples, we also show how DNA-binding domain sequence similarity\ncan yield confounding results as an indicator of transfer efficiency for\nmotif-based methods.\nCONCLUSIONS: Counter to standard practice, our evaluation of metrics to assess\nthe efficiency of methods for regulatory network information transfer reveals\nthat the area under precision-recall (PR) curves is a more precise and\ninformative metric than that of receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves,\nconfirming similar findings in other class-imbalanced settings. Our systematic\nassessment of transfer methods reveals that simple approaches to both motif- and \nnetwork-based transfer of regulatory information provide equal or better results \nthan more elaborate methods. We also show that there are not effective predictors\nof transfer efficacy, substantiating the long-standing practice of manual\ncuration in comparative genomics analyses.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1113-7 \nPMCID: PMC5009822\nPMID: 27586594  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Its\npopularity has been increasing, but relatively few studies address the parameter \nselection process: a critical step in model fitting. Due to numerous assertions\nregarding the performance reliability of the default parameters, many RF models\nare fit using these values. However there has not yet been a thorough examination\nof the parameter-sensitivity of RFs in computational genomic studies. We address \nthis gap here.\nRESULTS: We examined the effects of parameter selection on classification\nperformance using the RF machine learning algorithm on two biological datasets\nwith distinct p/n ratios: sequencing summary statistics (low p/n) and\nmicroarray-derived data (high p/n). Here, p, refers to the number of variables\nand, n, the number of samples. Our findings demonstrate that parameterization is \nhighly correlated with prediction accuracy and variable importance measures\n(VIMs). Further, we demonstrate that different parameters are critical in tuning \ndifferent datasets, and that parameter-optimization significantly enhances upon\nthe default parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: Parameter performance demonstrated wide variability on both low and \nhigh p/n data. Therefore, there is significant benefit to be gained by model\ntuning RFs away from their default parameter settings.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1228-x \nPMCID: PMC5009551\nPMID: 27586051  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

(2)School of Life Sciences, Northwestern\nPolytechnical University, Xi'an, 710072, China.\n\nBACKGROUND: There has been paid more and more attention to supervised\nclassification models in the area of predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs). \nHowever, in terms of classification, unavoidable missing DTIs in data would cause\nthree issues which have not yet been addressed appropriately by former\napproaches. Directly labeled as negatives (non-DTIs), missing DTIs increase the\nconfusion of positives (DTIs) and negatives, aggravate the imbalance between few \npositives and many negatives, and are usually discriminated as highly-scored\nfalse positives, which influence the existing measures sharply.\nRESULTS: Under the framework of local classification model (LCM), this work\nfocuses on the scenario of predicting how possibly a new drug interacts with\nknown targets. To address the first two issues, two strategies, Spy and\nSuper-target, are introduced accordingly and further integrated to form a\ntwo-layer LCM. In the bottom layer, Spy-based local classifiers for protein\ntargets are built by positives, as well as reliable negatives identified among\nunlabeled drug-target pairs. In the top layer, regular local classifiers specific\nto super-targets are built with more positives generated by grouping similar\ntargets and their interactions. Furthermore, to handle the third issue, an\nadditional performance measure, Coverage, is presented for assessing DTI\nprediction. The experiments based on benchmark datasets are finally performed\nunder five-fold cross validation of drugs to evaluate this approach. The main\nfindings are concluded as follows. (1) Both two individual strategies and their\ncombination are effective to missing DTIs, and the combination wins the best. (2)\nHaving the advantages of less confusing decision boundary at the bottom layer and\nless biased decision boundary at the top layer, our two-layer LCM outperforms two\nformer approaches. (3) Coverage is more robust to missing interactions than other\nmeasures and is able to evaluate how far one needs to go down the list of targets\nto cover all the proper targets of a drug.\nCONCLUSIONS: Proposing two strategies and one performance measure, this work has \naddressed the issues derived from missing interactions, which cause confusing and\nbiased decision boundaries in classifiers, as well as the inappropriate measure\nof predicting performance, in the scenario of predicting interactions between new\ndrugs and known targets.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1118-2 \nPMCID: PMC5009565\nPMID: 27585458  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

At present the functions of a large fraction of genes are\nunknown; improvements in sequence matching will improve gene annotations.\nUniversal amino acid substitution matrices such as Blosum62 are used to measure\nsequence similarities and to identify distant homologues, regardless of the\nstructure class. However, such single matrices do not take into account important\nstructural information evident within the different topologies of proteins and\ntreats substitutions within all protein folds identically. Others have suggested \nthat the use of structural information can lead to significant improvements in\nsequence matching but this has not yet been very effective. Here we develop novel\nsubstitution matrices that include not only general sequence information but also\nhave a topology specific component that is unique for each CATH topology. This\nnovel feature of using a combination of sequence and structure information for\neach protein topology significantly improves the sequence matching scores for the\nsequence pairs tested. We have used a novel multi-structure alignment method for \neach homology level of CATH in order to extract topological information.\nRESULTS: We obtain statistically significant improved sequence matching scores\nfor 73 % of the alpha helical test cases. On average, 61 % of the test cases\nshowed improvements in homology detection when structure information was\nincorporated into the substitution matrices. On average z-scores for homology\ndetection are improved by more than 54 % for all cases, and some individual cases\nhave z-scores more than twice those obtained using generic matrices. Our topology\nspecific similarity matrices also outperform other traditional similarity\nmatrices and single matrix based structure methods. When default amino acid\nsubstitution matrix in the Psi-blast algorithm is replaced by our structure-based\nmatrices, the structure matching is significantly improved over conventional\nPsi-blast. It also outperforms results obtained for the corresponding HMM\nprofiles generated for each topology.\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that by incorporating topology-specific structure\ninformation in addition to sequence information into specific amino acid\nsubstitution matrices, the sequence matching scores and homology detection are\nsignificantly improved. Our topology specific similarity matrices outperform\nother traditional similarity matrices, single matrix based structure methods,\nalso show improvement over conventional Psi-blast and HMM profile based methods\nin sequence matching. The results support the discriminatory ability of the new\namino acid similarity matrices to distinguish between distant homologs and\nstructurally dissimilar pairs.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1198-z \nPMCID: PMC5006591\nPMID: 27578239  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

In\nconventional volume rendering, it is often time consuming to set up a meaningful \nillumination environment. Moreover, conventional illumination approaches usually \nassign same values of variables of an illumination model to different structures \nmanually and thus neglect the important illumination variations due to structure \ndifferences.\nRESULTS: We introduce a novel illumination design paradigm for volume rendering\non the basis of topology to automate illumination parameter definitions\nmeaningfully. The topological features are extracted from the contour tree of an \ninput volumetric data. The automation of illumination design is achieved based on\nfour aspects of attenuation, distance, saliency, and contrast perception. To\nbetter distinguish structures and maximize illuminance perception differences of \nstructures, a two-phase topology-aware illuminance perception contrast model is\nproposed based on the psychological concept of Just-Noticeable-Difference.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach allows meaningful and efficient automatic\ngenerations of illumination in volume rendering.

Watson Research, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA.\n\nBACKGROUND: Given a set of biallelic molecular markers, such as SNPs, with\ngenotype values encoded numerically on a collection of plant, animal or human\nsamples, the goal of genetic trait prediction is to predict the quantitative\ntrait values by simultaneously modeling all marker effects. Genetic trait\nprediction is usually represented as linear regression models which require\nquantitative encodings for the genotypes. There are lots of work on the\nprediction algorithms, but none of the existing work investigated the effects of \nthe encodings on the genetic trait prediction problem.\nMETHODS: In this work, we view the genetic trait prediction problem from a novel \nangle: a multiple regression on categorical data problem, which requires encoding\nthe categorical data into numerical data. We further proposed two novel encoding \nmethods and we show that they are able to generate numerical features with higher\npredictive power.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our experiments show that our methods are superior to the\nother encoding methods for both single marker model and epistasis model. We\nshowed that the quantitative genetic trait prediction problem heavily depends on \nthe encoding of genotypes, for both single marker model and epistasis model.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conducted a detailed analysis on the performance of the hybrid\nencodings. To our knowledge, this is the first work that discusses the effects of\nencodings for genetic trait prediction problem.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1127-1 \nPMCID: PMC4959353\nPMID: 27454886  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Due to severe body deformation and mutual occlusion of multiple\nswimming fish, accurate and robust fish tracking from video image sequence is a\nhighly challenging problem. The current tracking methods based on motion\ninformation are not accurate and robust enough to track the waving body and\nhandle occlusion. In order to better overcome these problems, we propose a\nmultiple fish tracking method based on fish head detection.\nRESULTS: The shape and gray scale characteristics of the fish image are employed \nto locate the fish head position. For each detected fish head, we utilize the\ngray distribution of the head region to estimate the fish head direction. Both\nthe position and direction information from fish detection are then combined to\nbuild a cost function of fish swimming. Based on the cost function, global\noptimization method can be applied to associate the target between consecutive\nframes. Results show that our method can accurately detect the position and\ndirection information of fish head, and has a good tracking performance for\ndozens of fish.\nCONCLUSION: The proposed method can successfully obtain the motion trajectories\nfor dozens of fish so as to provide more precise data to accommodate systematic\nanalysis of fish behavior.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1138-y \nPMCID: PMC4917973\nPMID: 27338122  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

However, the\ncurrently available multi-omics datasets inevitably suffer from missing values\ndue to technical limitations and various constrains in experiments. These missing\nvalues severely hinder integrative analysis of multi-omics data. Current\nimputation methods mainly focus on using single omics data while ignoring\nbiological interconnections and information imbedded in multi-omics data sets.\nRESULTS: In this study, a novel multi-omics imputation method was proposed to\nintegrate multiple correlated omics datasets for improving the imputation\naccuracy. Our method was designed to: 1) combine the estimates of missing value\nfrom individual omics data itself as well as from other omics, and 2)\nsimultaneously impute multiple missing omics datasets by an iterative algorithm. \nWe compared our method with five imputation methods using single omics data at\ndifferent noise levels, sample sizes and data missing rates. The results\ndemonstrated the advantage and efficiency of our method, consistently in terms of\nthe imputation error and the recovery of mRNA-miRNA network structure.\nCONCLUSIONS: We concluded that our proposed imputation method can utilize more\nbiological information to minimize the imputation error and thus can improve the \nperformance of downstream analysis such as genetic regulatory network\nconstruction.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1122-6 \nPMCID: PMC4915152\nPMID: 27329642  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Most data generated using such methods are used to\nencode large amounts of rich information, and determine diagnostic and prognostic\nbiomarkers. Although data storage costs have reduced, process of capturing data\nusing aforementioned technologies is still expensive. Moreover, the time required\nfor the assay, from sample preparation to raw value measurement is excessive (in \nthe order of days). There is an opportunity to reduce both the cost and time for \ngenerating such expression datasets.\nRESULTS: We propose a framework in which complete gene expression values can be\nreliably predicted in-silico from partial measurements. This is achieved by\nmodelling expression data as a low-rank matrix and then applying recently\ndiscovered techniques of matrix completion by using nonlinear convex\noptimisation. We evaluated prediction of gene expression data based on 133\nstudies, sourced from a combined total of 10,921 samples. It is shown that such\ndatasets can be constructed with a low relative error even at high missing value \nrates (>50 %), and that such predicted datasets can be reliably used as\nsurrogates for further analysis.\nCONCLUSION: This method has potentially far-reaching applications including how\nbio-medical data is sourced and generated, and transcriptomic prediction by\noptimisation.

Leaf senescence is a\ncomplex mechanism controlled by multiple genetic and environmental variables,\nwhich has a strong impact on crop yield. Transcription factors (TFs) are key\nproteins in the regulation of gene expression, regulating different signaling\npathways; their function is crucial for triggering and/or regulating different\naspects of the leaf senescence process. The study of TF interactions and their\nintegration with metabolic profiles under different developmental conditions,\nespecially for a non-model organism such as sunflower, will open new insights\ninto the details of gene regulation of leaf senescence.\nRESULTS: Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) and BioSignature\nDiscoverer (BioSD, Gnosis Data Analysis, Heraklion, Greece) were used to\nintegrate transcriptomic and metabolomic data. WGCNA allowed the detection of 10 \nmetabolites and 13 TFs whereas BioSD allowed the detection of 1 metabolite and 6 \nTFs as potential biomarkers. The comparative analysis demonstrated that three\ntranscription factors were detected through both methodologies, highlighting them\nas potentially robust biomarkers associated with leaf senescence in sunflower.\nCONCLUSIONS: The complementary use of network and BioSignature Discoverer\nanalysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data provided a useful tool for\nidentifying candidate genes and metabolites which may have a role during the\ntriggering and development of the leaf senescence process. The WGCNA tool allowed\nus to design and test a hypothetical network in order to infer relationships\nacross selected transcription factor and metabolite candidate biomarkers involved\nin leaf senescence, whereas BioSignature Discoverer selected transcripts and\nmetabolites which discriminate between different ages of sunflower plants. The\nmethodology presented here would help to elucidate and predict novel networks and\npotential biomarkers of leaf senescence in sunflower.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1045-2 \nPMCID: PMC4905614\nPMID: 27295368  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

In this \nstudy we present an approach to integrate these ~ omics data sets for the purpose\nof predicting phenotypic traits. This gives us networks of relatively small sets \nof interrelated ~ omics variables that can predict, with higher accuracy, a\nquality trait of interest.\nRESULTS: We used Random Forest regression for integrating multiple ~ omics data\nfor prediction of four quality traits of potato: tuber flesh colour, DSC onset,\ntuber shape and enzymatic discoloration. For tuber flesh colour beta-carotene\nhydroxylase and zeaxanthin epoxidase were ranked first and forty-fourth\nrespectively both of which have previously been associated with flesh colour in\npotato tubers. Combining all the significant genes, LC-peaks, GC-peaks and\nproteins, the variation explained was 75 %, only slightly more than what gene\nexpression or LC-MS data explain by themselves which indicates that there are\ncorrelations among the variables across data sets. For tuber shape regressed on\nthe gene expression, LC-MS, GC-MS and proteomics data sets separately, only gene \nexpression data was found to explain significant variation. For DSC onset, we\nfound 12 significant gene expression, 5 metabolite levels (GC) and 2 proteins\nthat are associated with the trait. Using those 19 significant variables, the\nvariation explained was 45 %. Expression QTL (eQTL) analyses showed many\nassociations with genomic regions in chromosome 2 with also the highest explained\nvariation compared to other chromosomes. Transcriptomics and metabolomics\nanalysis on enzymatic discoloration after 5 min resulted in 420 significant genes\nand 8 significant LC metabolites, among which two were putatively identified as\ncaffeoylquinic acid methyl ester and tyrosine.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, we made a strategy for selecting and integrating\nmultiple ~ omics data using random forest method and selected representative\nindividual peaks for networks based on eQTL, mQTL or pQTL information.

In this paper these three methods are compared with\nrespect to their mathematical properties and their respective ways of defining\ncommon and distinctive variation.\nRESULTS: The methods are all applied on simulated data and mRNA and miRNA\ndata-sets from GlioBlastoma Multiform (GBM) brain tumors to examine their overlap\nand differences. When the common variation is abundant, all methods are able to\nfind the correct solution. With real data however, complexities in the data are\ntreated differently by the three methods.\nCONCLUSIONS: All three methods have their own approach to estimate common and\ndistinctive variation with their specific strength and weaknesses. Due to their\northogonality properties and their used algorithms their view on the data is\nslightly different. By assuming orthogonality between common and distinctive,\ntrue natural or biological phenomena that may not be orthogonal at all might be\nmisinterpreted.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1037-2 \nPMCID: PMC4905617\nPMID: 27294690  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

(2)Department for\nEvolutionary Biology, Max-Planck-Institute for Developmental Biology,\nSpemannstrasse 35, 72076, Tübingen, Germany.\nchristian.roedelsperger@tuebingen.mpg.de.\n\nBACKGROUND: Current genome sequencing projects reveal substantial numbers of\ntaxonomically restricted, so called orphan genes that lack homology with genes\nfrom other evolutionary lineages. However, it is not clear to what extent orphan \ngenes are real, genomic artifacts, or represent non-coding RNAs.\nRESULTS: Here, we use a simple set of assumptions to test the nature of orphan\ngenes. First, a sequence that is transcribed is considered a real biological\nentity. Second, every sequence that is supported by proteome data or shows a\ndepletion of non-synonymous substitutions is a protein-coding gene. Using\ngenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data for the nematode Pristionchus\npacificus, we show that between 4129-7997 (42-81 %) of predicted orphan genes are\nexpressed and 3818-7545 (39-76 %) of orphan genes are under negative selection.\nIn three cases that exhibited strong evolutionary constraint but lacked\nexpression evidence in 14 RNA-seq samples, we could experimentally validate the\npredicted gene structures. Comparing different data sets to infer selection on\norphan gene clusters, we find that the presence of a closely related genome\nprovides the most powerful resource to robustly identify evidence of negative\nselection. However, even in the absence of other genomic data, the availability\nof paralogous sequences was enough to show negative selection in 8-10 % of orphan\ngenes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the great majority of previously identified\norphan genes in P. pacificus are indeed protein-coding genes. Even though this\nwork represents a case study on a single species, our approach can be transferred\nto genomic data of other non-model organisms in order to ascertain the\nprotein-coding nature of orphan genes.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1102-x \nPMCID: PMC4888513\nPMID: 27245157  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

However, it remains a challenge to delineate the key cancer \ndriver genes from the regions encoding a large number of genes.\nRESULTS: In this study, we developed a new approach to CNV analysis based on\nspectral decomposition of CNV profiles into focal CNVs and broad CNVs. We\nperformed an analysis of CNV data of 587 serous ovarian cancer samples on\nmultiple platforms. We identified a number of novel focal regions, such as focal \ngain of ESR1, focal loss of LSAMP, prognostic site at 3q26.2 and losses of\nsub-telomere regions in multiple chromosomes. Furthermore, we performed network\nmodularity analysis to examine the relationships among genes encoded in the focal\nCNV regions. Our results also showed that the recurrent focal gains were\nsignificantly associated with the known oncogenes and recurrent losses associated\nwith TSGs and the CNVs had a greater effect on the mRNA expression of the driver \ngenes than that of the non-driver genes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that spectral decomposition of CNV profiles \noffers a new way of understanding the role of CNVs in cancer.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1085-7 \nPMCID: PMC4881176\nPMID: 27230211  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Efficient data mining strategies are in high demand for large scale\ncomparative and evolutional studies to be performed on the large amounts of data \nderived from NGS projects. Topic modeling is an active research field in machine \nlearning and has been mainly used as an analytical tool to structure large\ntextual corpora for data mining.\nMETHODS: We report a novel procedure to analyse NGS data using topic modeling. It\nconsists of four major procedures: NGS data retrieval, preprocessing, topic\nmodeling, and data mining using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic outputs. \nThe NGS data set of the Salmonella enterica strains were used as a case study to \nshow the workflow of this procedure. The perplexity measurement of the topic\nnumbers and the convergence efficiencies of Gibbs sampling were calculated and\ndiscussed for achieving the best result from the proposed procedure.\nRESULTS: The output topics by LDA algorithms could be treated as features of\nSalmonella strains to accurately describe the genetic diversity of fliC gene in\nvarious serotypes. The results of a two-way hierarchical clustering and data\nmatrix analysis on LDA-derived matrices successfully classified Salmonella\nserotypes based on the NGS data. The implementation of topic modeling in NGS data\nanalysis procedure provides a new way to elucidate genetic information from NGS\ndata, and identify the gene-phenotype relationships and biomarkers, especially in\nthe era of biological and medical big data.\nCONCLUSION: The implementation of topic modeling in NGS data analysis provides a \nnew way to elucidate genetic information from NGS data, and identify the\ngene-phenotype relationships and biomarkers, especially in the era of biological \nand medical big data.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1075-9 \nPMCID: PMC4866036\nPMID: 27177941  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

There is\nincreasing evidence becoming available showing that breast cancer progression is \nassociated with a defect in EGFR endocytosis. In order to find related\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) regulators in this process, high-throughput imaging with\nfluorescent markers is used to visualize the complex EGFR endocytosis process.\nSubsequently a dedicated automatic image and data analysis system is developed\nand applied to extract the phenotype measurement and distinguish different\ndevelopmental episodes from a huge amount of images acquired through\nhigh-throughput imaging. For the image analysis, a phenotype measurement\nquantifies the important image information into distinct features or\nmeasurements. Therefore, the manner in which prominent measurements are chosen to\nrepresent the dynamics of the EGFR process becomes a crucial step for the\nidentification of the phenotype. In the subsequent data analysis, classification \nis used to categorize each observation by making use of all prominent\nmeasurements obtained from image analysis. Therefore, a better construction for a\nclassification strategy will support to raise the performance level in our image \nand data analysis system.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we illustrate an integrated analysis method for EGFR\nsignalling through image analysis of microscopy images. Sophisticated\nwavelet-based texture measurements are used to obtain a good description of the\ncharacteristic stages in the EGFR signalling. A hierarchical classification\nstrategy is designed to improve the recognition of phenotypic episodes of EGFR\nduring endocytosis. Different strategies for normalization, feature selection and\nclassification are evaluated.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of performance assessment clearly demonstrate that our\nhierarchical classification scheme combined with a selected set of features\nprovides a notable improvement in the temporal analysis of EGFR endocytosis.\nMoreover, it is shown that the addition of the wavelet-based texture features\ncontributes to this improvement. Our workflow can be applied to drug discovery to\nanalyze defected EGFR endocytosis processes.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1053-2 \nPMCID: PMC4855371\nPMID: 27142862  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

System biology attempts to\nunderstand cellular organization and function by analyzing these PPI networks.\nHowever, most studies still focus on static PPI networks which neglect the\ndynamic information of PPI.\nRESULTS: The gene expression data under different time points and conditions can \nreveal the dynamic information of proteins. In this study, we used an active\nprobability-based method to distinguish the active level of proteins at different\nactive time points. We constructed dynamic probabilistic protein networks (DPPN) \nto integrate dynamic information of protein into static PPI networks. Based on\nDPPN, we subsequently proposed a novel method to identify protein complexes,\nwhich could effectively exploit topological structure as well as dynamic\ninformation of DPPN. We used three different yeast PPI datasets and gene\nexpression data to construct three DPPNs. When applied to three DPPNs, many\nwell-characterized protein complexes were accurately identified by this method.\nCONCLUSION: The shift from static PPI networks to dynamic PPI networks is\nessential to accurately identify protein complex. This method not only can be\napplied to identify protein complex, but also establish a framework to integrate \ndynamic information into static networks for other applications, such as pathway \nanalysis.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1054-1 \nPMCID: PMC4847341\nPMID: 27117946  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Coreference\nresolution is a foundational yet challenging natural language processing task\nwhich, if performed successfully, is likely to enhance such systems\nsignificantly. In this paper, we propose a semantically oriented, rule-based\nmethod to resolve sortal anaphora, a specific type of coreference that forms the \nmajority of coreference instances in biomedical literature. The method addresses \nall entity types and relies on linguistic components of SemRep, a broad-coverage \nbiomedical relation extraction system. It has been incorporated into SemRep,\nextending its core semantic interpretation capability from sentence level to\ndiscourse level.\nRESULTS: We evaluated our sortal anaphora resolution method in several ways. The \nfirst evaluation specifically focused on sortal anaphora relations. Our\nmethodology achieved a F1 score of 59.6 on the test portion of a manually\nannotated corpus of 320 Medline abstracts, a 4-fold improvement over the baseline\nmethod. Investigating the impact of sortal anaphora resolution on relation\nextraction, we found that the overall effect was positive, with 50 % of the\nchanges involving uninformative relations being replaced by more specific and\ninformative ones, while 35 % of the changes had no effect, and only 15 % were\nnegative. We estimate that anaphora resolution results in changes in about 1.5 % \nof approximately 82 million semantic relations extracted from the entire PubMed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that a heavily semantic approach to sortal\nanaphora resolution is largely effective for biomedical literature. Our\nevaluation and error analysis highlight some areas for further improvements, such\nas coordination processing and intra-sentential antecedent selection.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1009-6 \nPMCID: PMC4832532\nPMID: 27080229  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

We address\nthe question if model selection matters topologically, that is, if conducting ML \ninferences under the optimal, instead of a standard General Time Reversible\nmodel, yields different tree topologies. We also assess, to which degree models\nselected and trees inferred under the three standard criteria (AIC, AICc, BIC)\ndiffer. Finally, we assess if the definition of the sample size (#sites versus\n#sites × #taxa) yields different models and, as a consequence, different tree\ntopologies.\nRESULTS: We find that, all three factors (by order of impact: nucleotide model\nselection, information criterion used, sample size definition) can yield\ntopologically substantially different final tree topologies (topological\ndifference exceeding 10 %) for approximately 5 % of the tree inferences conducted\non the 39 empirical datasets used in our study.\nCONCLUSIONS: We find that, using the best-fit nucleotide substitution model may\nchange the final ML tree topology compared to an inference under a default GTR\nmodel. The effect is less pronounced when comparing distinct information\ncriteria. Nonetheless, in some cases we did obtain substantial topological\ndifferences.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0985-x \nPMCID: PMC4806516\nPMID: 27009141  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Feature selection is an NP-hard\nproblem. Due to the exponentially increased time requirement for finding the\nglobally optimal solution, all the existing feature selection algorithms employ\nheuristic rules to find locally optimal solutions, and their solutions achieve\ndifferent performances on different datasets.\nRESULTS: This work describes a feature selection algorithm based on a recently\npublished correlation measurement, Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC). The\nproposed algorithm, McTwo, aims to select features associated with phenotypes,\nindependently of each other, and achieving high classification performance of the\nnearest neighbor algorithm. Based on the comparative study of 17 datasets, McTwo \nperforms about as well as or better than existing algorithms, with significantly \nreduced numbers of selected features. The features selected by McTwo also appear \nto have particular biomedical relevance to the phenotypes from the literature.\nCONCLUSION: McTwo selects a feature subset with very good classification\nperformance, as well as a small feature number. So McTwo may represent a\ncomplementary feature selection algorithm for the high-dimensional biomedical\ndatasets.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0990-0 \nPMCID: PMC4804474\nPMID: 27006077  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Restricted by\ncurrent sequencing techniques, the massive sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons \nencompassing the full length of genes is not yet feasible. Thus, the selection of\nthe most efficient hypervariable regions for phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic \nclassification is still debated. In the present study, several bioinformatics\ntools were integrated to build an in silico pipeline to evaluate the phylogenetic\nsensitivity of the hypervariable regions compared with the corresponding\nfull-length sequences.\nRESULTS: The correlation of seven sub-regions was inferred from the geodesic\ndistance, a parameter that is applied to quantitatively compare the topology of\ndifferent phylogenetic trees constructed using the sequences from different\nsub-regions. The relationship between different sub-regions based on the geodesic\ndistance indicated that V4-V6 were the most reliable regions for representing the\nfull-length 16S rRNA sequences in the phylogenetic analysis of most bacterial\nphyla, while V2 and V8 were the least reliable regions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that V4-V6 might be optimal sub-regions for the \ndesign of universal primers with superior phylogenetic resolution for bacterial\nphyla. A potential relationship between function and the evolution of 16S rRNA is\nalso discussed.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0992-y \nPMCID: PMC4802574\nPMID: 27000765  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Protein networks are one\nparticular network type of special importance, because proteins form the\nfunctional base units of every biological cell. On a mesoscopic level of protein \nnetworks, modules are of significant importance because these building blocks may\nbe the next elementary functional level above individual proteins allowing to\ngain insight into fundamental organizational principles of biological cells.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of five popular and\nfour novel module detection algorithms. We study these module prediction methods \nfor simulated benchmark networks as well as 10 biological protein interaction\nnetworks (PINs). A particular focus of our analysis is placed on the biological\nmeaning of the predicted modules by utilizing the Gene Ontology (GO) database as \ngold standard for the definition of biological processes. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the robustness of the results by perturbing the PINs simulating in\nthis way our incomplete knowledge of protein networks.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study reveals that there is a large heterogeneity among\nthe different module prediction algorithms if one zooms-in the biological level\nof biological processes in the form of GO terms and all methods are severely\naffected by a slight perturbation of the networks. However, we also find pathways\nthat are enriched in multiple modules, which could provide important information \nabout the hierarchical organization of the system.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0979-8 \nPMCID: PMC4797184\nPMID: 26987731  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Prediction is generally guided\nby some classification and inference based methods using single biological source\nof information.\nRESULTS: In this article we have proposed a novel framework to predict\nprotein-protein interactions (PPIs) between HIV-1 and human proteins by\nintegrating multiple biological sources of information through non negative\nmatrix factorization (NMF). For this purpose, the multiple data sets are\nconverted to biological networks, which are then utilized to predict modules.\nThese modules are subsequently combined into meta-modules by using NMF based\nclustering method. The integrated meta-modules are used to predict novel\ninteractions between HIV-1 and human proteins. We have analyzed the significant\nGO terms and KEGG pathways in which the human proteins of the meta-modules\nparticipate. Moreover, the topological properties of human proteins involved in\nthe meta modules are investigated. We have also performed statistical\nsignificance test to evaluate the predictions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Here, we propose a novel approach based on integration of different \nbiological data sources, for predicting PPIs between HIV-1 and human proteins.\nHere, the integration is achieved through non negative matrix factorization (NMF)\ntechnique. Most of the predicted interactions are found to be well supported by\nthe existing literature in PUBMED. Moreover, human proteins in the predicted set \nemerge as 'hubs' and 'bottlenecks' in the analysis. Low p-value in the\nsignificance test also suggests that the predictions are statistically\nsignificant.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0952-6 \nPMCID: PMC4784399\nPMID: 26956556  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Enumeration of chemical compounds is essential not only for the\npurpose, but also for analysis of chemical space and structure elucidation. In\nour previous study, we developed enumeration methods BfsSimEnum and BfsMulEnum\nfor tree-like chemical compounds using a tree-structure to represent a chemical\ncompound, which is limited to acyclic chemical compounds only.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we extend the methods, and develop BfsBenNaphEnum that\ncan enumerate tree-like chemical compounds containing benzene rings and\nnaphthalene rings, which include benzene isomers and naphthalene isomers such as \northo, meta, and para, by treating a benzene ring as an atom with valence six,\ninstead of a ring of six carbon atoms, and treating a naphthalene ring as two\nbenzene rings having a special bond. We compare our method with MOLGEN 5.0, which\nis a well-known general purpose structure generator, to enumerate chemical\nstructures from a set of chemical formulas in terms of the number of enumerated\nstructures and the computational time. The result suggests that our proposed\nmethod can reduce the computational time efficiently.\nCONCLUSIONS: We propose the enumeration method BfsBenNaphEnum for tree-like\nchemical compounds containing benzene rings and naphthalene rings as cyclic\nstructures. BfsBenNaphEnum was from 50 times to 5,000,000 times faster than\nMOLGEN 5.0 for instances with 8 to 14 carbon atoms in our experiments.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0962-4 \nPMCID: PMC4774041\nPMID: 26932529  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

There are two sources\nof false discoveries, one due to multiple testing involving several pairwise\ncomparisons and the second due to falsely declaring a feature to be up (or down) \nregulated when it is not (known as directional error). Together, the total error \nrate is called the mixed directional false discovery rate (mdFDR).\nRESULTS: We develop a general powerful mdFDR controlling testing procedure and\nillustrate the methodology by analyzing uterine fibroid gene expression data\n(PLoS ONE 8:63909, 2013). We identify several differentially expressed genes\n(DEGs) and pathways that are specifically enriched according to the size of a\nuterine fibroid.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed general procedure strongly controls mdFDR. Several\nspecific methodologies can be derived from this general methodology by using\nappropriate testing procedures at different steps of the general procedure. Thus \nwe are providing a general framework for making multiple pairwise comparisons.\nOur analysis of the uterine fibroid growth gene expression data suggests that\nmolecular characteristics of a fibroid changes with size. Our powerful\nmethodology allowed us to draw several interesting conclusions regarding the\nmolecular characteristics of uterine fibroids. For example, IL-1 signaling\npathway (Sci STKE 2003:3, 2003), associated with inflammation and known to\nactivate prostaglandins that are implicated in the progression of fibroids, is\nsignificantly enriched only in small tumors (volume < 5.7 cm (3)). It appears\nthat the molecular apparatus necessary for fibroid growth and development is\nestablished during tumor development. A complete list of all DEGs and the\ncorresponding enriched pathways according to tumor size is provided for\nresearchers to mine these data. Identification of these DEGs and the pathways may\npotentially have clinical implications.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0937-5 \nPMCID: PMC4768411\nPMID: 26917217  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

The main network\nreconstruction approaches are either based on Bayesian scores, which enable the\nranking of alternative Bayesian networks, or rely on the identification of\nstructural independencies, which correspond to missing edges in the underlying\nnetwork. Bayesian inference methods typically require heuristic search\nstrategies, such as hill-climbing algorithms, to sample the super-exponential\nspace of possible networks. By contrast, constraint-based methods, such as the PC\nand IC algorithms, are expected to run in polynomial time on sparse underlying\ngraphs, provided that a correct list of conditional independencies is available. \nYet, in practice, conditional independencies need to be ascertained from the\navailable observational data, based on adjustable statistical significance\nlevels, and are not robust to sampling noise from finite datasets.\nRESULTS: We propose a more robust approach to reconstruct graphical models from\nfinite datasets. It combines constraint-based and Bayesian approaches to infer\nstructural independencies based on the ranking of their most likely contributing \nnodes. In a nutshell, this local optimization scheme and corresponding 3off2\nalgorithm iteratively \"take off\" the most likely conditional 3-point information \nfrom the 2-point (mutual) information between each pair of nodes. Conditional\nindependencies are thus derived by progressively collecting the most significant \nindirect contributions to all pairwise mutual information. The resulting network \nskeleton is then partially directed by orienting and propagating edge directions,\nbased on the sign and magnitude of the conditional 3-point information of\nunshielded triples. The approach is shown to outperform both constraint-based and\nBayesian inference methods on a range of benchmark networks. The 3off2 approach\nis then applied to the reconstruction of the hematopoiesis regulation network\nbased on recent single cell expression data and is found to retrieve more\nexperimentally ascertained regulations between transcription factors than with\nother available methods.\nCONCLUSIONS: The novel information-theoretic approach and corresponding 3off2\nalgorithm combine constraint-based and Bayesian inference methods to reliably\nreconstruct graphical models, despite inherent sampling noise in finite datasets.\nIn particular, experimentally verified interactions as well as novel predicted\nregulations are established on the hematopoiesis regulatory networks based on\nsingle cell expression data.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0856-x \nPMCID: PMC4959376\nPMID: 26823190  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Study of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and reduced \nrepresentation bisulfite sequencing brings the availability of DNA methylation at\nsingle CpG resolution. The main interest of study on DNA methylation data is to\ntest the methylation difference under two conditions of biological samples.\nHowever, the high cost and complexity of this sequencing experiment limits the\nnumber of biological replicates, which brings challenges to the development of\nstatistical methods.\nRESULTS: Bayesian modeling is well known to be able to borrow strength across the\ngenome, and hence is a powerful tool for high-dimensional-low-sample-size data.\nIn order to provide accurate identification of methylation loci, especially for\nlow coverage data, we propose a full Bayesian partition model to detect\ndifferentially methylated loci under two conditions of scientific study. Since\nhypo-methylation and hyper-methylation have distinct biological implication, it\nis desirable to differentiate these two types of differential methylation.

To prevent the spread of\nthe disease, early diagnosis is crucial. However, current methods of detection\nrequire improvement in sensitivity, efficiency or specificity. In the present\nstudy, we conducted a microarray experiment, comparing the gene expression\nprofiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells among individuals with active \nTB, latent infection, and healthy conditions in a Taiwanese population.\nRESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that most of the differentially\nexpressed genes belonged to immune responses, inflammation pathways, and cell\ncycle control. Subsequent RT-PCR validation identified four differentially\nexpressed genes, NEMF, ASUN, DHX29, and PTPRC, as potential biomarkers for the\ndetection of active and latent TB infections. Receiver operating characteristic\nanalysis showed that the expression level of PTPRC may discriminate active TB\npatients from healthy individuals, while ASUN could differentiate between the\nlatent state of TB infection and healthy condidtion. In contrast, DHX29 may be\nused to identify latently infected individuals among active TB patients or\nhealthy individuals. To test the concept of using these biomarkers as diagnostic \nsupport, we constructed classification models using these candidate biomarkers\nand found the Naïve Bayes-based model built with ASUN, DHX29, and PTPRC to yield \nthe best performance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that gene expression profiles in the blood\ncan be used to identify not only active TB patients, but also to differentiate\nlatently infected patients from their healthy counterparts. Validation of the\nconstructed computational model in a larger sample size would confirm the\nreliability of the biomarkers and facilitate the development of a cost-effective \nand sensitive molecular diagnostic platform for TB.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0848-x \nPMCID: PMC4895247\nPMID: 26818387  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

DNA sequence intrinsic features such as predicted binding affinity\nare often not very effective in predicting in vivo site occupancy and in any case\ncould not explain cell-type specific binding events. Recent reports show that\nchromatin accessibility, nucleosome occupancy and specific histone\npost-translational modifications greatly influence TF site occupancy in vivo. In \nthis work, we use machine-learning methods to build predictive models and assess \nthe relative importance of different sequence-intrinsic and chromatin features in\nthe TF-to-target-site recruitment process.\nMETHODS: Our study primarily relies on recent data published by the ENCODE\nconsortium. Five dissimilar TFs assayed in multiple cell-types were selected as\nexamples: CTCF, JunD, REST, GABP and USF2. We used two types of candidate target \nsites: (a) predicted sites obtained by scanning the whole genome with a position \nweight matrix, and (b) cell-type specific peak lists provided by ENCODE.\nQuantitative in vivo occupancy levels in different cell-types were based on\nChIP-seq data for the corresponding TFs. In parallel, we computed a number of\nassociated sequence-intrinsic and experimental features (histone modification,\nDNase I hypersensitivity, etc.) for each site. Machine learning algorithms were\nthen used in a binary classification and regression framework to predict site\noccupancy and binding strength, for the purpose of assessing the relative\nimportance of different contextual features.\nRESULTS: We observed striking differences in the feature importance rankings\nbetween the five factors tested. PWM-scores were amongst the most important\nfeatures only for CTCF and REST but of little value for JunD and USF2. Chromatin \naccessibility and active histone marks are potent predictors for all factors\nexcept REST. Structural DNA parameters, repressive and gene body associated\nhistone marks are generally of little or no predictive value.\nCONCLUSIONS: We define a general and extensible computational framework for\nanalyzing the importance of various DNA-intrinsic and chromatin-associated\nfeatures in determining cell-type specific TF binding to target sites. The\napplication of our methodology to ENCODE data has led to new insights on\ntranscription regulatory processes and may serve as example for future studies\nencompassing even larger datasets.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0846-z \nPMCID: PMC4895346\nPMID: 26818008  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

These associated\nmolecules are highly predictive of the potential functions of proteins. The\nassociation of a protein and a molecule can be determined from their\nco-occurrences in biomedical abstracts. Extensive semantically related\nco-occurrences of a protein's name and a molecule's name in the sentences of\nbiomedical abstracts can be considered as indicative of the association between\nthe protein and the molecule. Dependency parsers extract textual relations from a\ntext by determining the grammatical relations between words in a sentence. They\ncan be used for determining the textual relations between proteins and molecules.\nDespite their success, they may extract textual relations with low precision.\nThis is because they do not consider the semantic relationships between terms in \na sentence (i.e., they consider only the structural relationships between the\nterms). Moreover, they may not be well suited for complex sentences and for\nlong-distance textual relations.\nRESULTS: We introduce an information extraction system called PPFBM that predicts\nthe functions of unannotated proteins from the molecules that associate with\nthese proteins. PPFBM represents each protein by the other molecules that\nassociate with it in the abstracts referenced in the protein's entries in\nreliable biological databases. It automatically extracts each co-occurrence of a \nprotein-molecule pair that represents semantic relationship between the pair.\nTowards this, we present novel semantic rules that identify the semantic\nrelationship between each co-occurrence of a protein-molecule pair using the\nsyntactic structures of sentences and linguistics theories. PPFBM determines the \nfunctions of an un-annotated protein p as follows. First, it determines the set S\nr of annotated proteins that is semantically similar to p by matching the\nmolecules representing p and the annotated proteins. Then, it assigns p the\nfunctional category FC if the significance of the frequency of occurrences of S r\nin abstracts associated with proteins annotated with FC is statistically\nsignificantly different than the significance of the frequency of occurrences of \nS r in abstracts associated with proteins annotated with all other functional\ncategories. We evaluated the quality of PPFBM by comparing it experimentally with\ntwo other systems. Results showed marked improvement.\nCONCLUSIONS: The experimental results demonstrated that PPFBM outperforms other\nsystems that predict protein function from the textual information found within\nbiomedical abstracts. This is because these system do not consider the semantic\nrelationships between terms in a sentence (i.e., they consider only the\nstructural relationships between the terms). PPFBM's performance over these\nsystem increases steadily as the number of training protein increases. That is,\nPPFBM's prediction performance becomes more accurate constantly, as the size of\ntraining proteins gets larger. This is because every time a new set of test\nproteins is added to the current set of training proteins.

Interpretation of flow\ncytometry data is hard; the instrumentation is delicate and can not render\nabsolute measurements, hence samples can only be interpreted in relation to each \nother while at the same time comparisons are confounded by inter-sample\nvariation. Despite this, most automated flow cytometry data analysis methods\neither treat samples individually or ignore the variation by for example pooling \nthe data. A key requirement for models that include multiple samples is the\nability to visualize and assess inferred variation, since what could be technical\nvariation in one setting would be different phenotypes in another.\nRESULTS: We introduce BayesFlow, a pipeline for latent modeling of flow cytometry\ncell populations built upon a Bayesian hierarchical model. The model systematizes\nvariation in location as well as shape. Expert knowledge can be incorporated\nthrough informative priors and the results can be supervised through compact and \ncomprehensive visualizations. BayesFlow is applied to two synthetic and two real \nflow cytometry data sets. For the first real data set, taken from the FlowCAP I\nchallenge, BayesFlow does not only give a gating which would place it among the\ntop performers in FlowCAP I for this dataset, it also gives a more consistent\ntreatment of different samples than either manual gating or other automated\ngating methods. The second real data set contains replicated flow cytometry\nmeasurements of samples from healthy individuals. BayesFlow gives here cell\npopulations with clear expression patterns and small technical intra-donor\nvariation as compared to biological inter-donor variation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Modeling latent relations between samples through BayesFlow enables \na systematic analysis of inter-sample variation. As opposed to other joint gating\nmethods, effort is put at ensuring that the obtained partition of the data\ncorresponds to actual cell populations, and the result is therefore directly\nbiologically interpretable.

Consequently, the need for fast structural search against\ncomplete databases without a significant loss of accuracy is increasingly\ndemanding. Recently, TopSearch, an ultra-fast method for finding rigid structural\nrelationships between a query structure and the complete Protein Data Bank (PDB),\nat the multi-chain level, has been released. However, comparable accurate\nflexible structural aligners to perform efficient whole database searches of\nmulti-domain proteins are not yet available. The availability of such a tool is\ncritical for a sustainable boosting of biological discovery.\nRESULTS: Here we report on the development of a new method for the fast and\nflexible comparison of protein structure chains. The method relies on the\ncalculation of 2D matrices containing a description of the three-dimensional\narrangement of secondary structure elements (angles and distances). The\ncomparison involves the matching of an ensemble of substructures through a\nnested-two-steps dynamic programming algorithm. The unique features of this new\napproach are the integration and trade-off balancing of the following: 1) speed, \n2) accuracy and 3) global and semiglobal flexible structure alignment by\nintegration of local substructure matching. The comparison, and matching with\ncompetitive accuracy, of one medium sized (250-aa) query structure against the\ncomplete PDB database (216,322 protein chains) takes about 8 min using an average\ndesktop computer. The method is at least 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than\nother tested tools with similar accuracy. We validate the performance of the\nmethod for fold and superfamily assignment in a large benchmark set of protein\nstructures. We finally provide a series of examples to illustrate the usefulness \nof this method and its application in biological discovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: The method is able to detect partial structure matching, rigid body \nshifts, conformational changes and tolerates substantial structural variation\narising from insertions, deletions and sequence divergence, as well as structural\nconvergence of unrelated proteins.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0866-8 \nPMCID: PMC4702403\nPMID: 26732380  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The measurements consider the whole\ngenome, and the large number of generated data requires sophisticated analysis.\nTo date, no gold-standard for the analysis of microarray images has been\nestablished. Due to the lack of a standard approach there is a strong need to\nidentify new processing algorithms.\nMETHODS: We propose a novel approach based on hyperbolic partial differential\nequations (PDEs) for unsupervised spot segmentation. Prior to segmentation,\nmorphological operations were applied for the identification of co-localized\ngroups of spots. A grid alignment was performed to determine the borderlines\nbetween rows and columns of spots. PDEs were applied to detect the inflection\npoints within each column and row; vertical and horizontal luminance profiles\nwere evolved respectively. The inflection points of the profiles determined\nborderlines that confined a spot within adapted rectangular areas. A subsequent\nk-means clustering determined the pixels of each individual spot and its local\nbackground.\nRESULTS: We evaluated the approach for a data set of microarray images taken from\nthe Stanford Microarray Database (SMD). The data set is based on two studies on\nglobal gene expression profiles of Arabidopsis Thaliana. We computed values for\nspot intensity, regression ratio, and coefficient of determination. For spots\nwith irregular contours and inner holes, we found intensity values that were\nsignificantly different from those determined by the GenePix Pro microarray\nanalysis software. We determined the set of differentially expressed genes from\nour intensities and identified more activated genes than were predicted by the\nGenePix software.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our method represents a worthwhile alternative and complement to\nstandard approaches used in industry and academy. We highlight the importance of \nour spot segmentation approach, which identified supplementary important genes,\nto better explains the molecular mechanisms that are activated in a defense\nresponses to virus and pathogen infection.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0842-3 \nPMCID: PMC4690322\nPMID: 26698293  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In bacteria, inversions are \none of the most frequently observed rearrangements. In some bacterial families,\ninversions are biased in favor of symmetry as shown by recent research. In\naddition, several results suggest that short segment inversions are more frequent\nin the evolution of microbial genomes. Despite the fact that symmetry and length \nof the reversed segments seem very important, they have not been considered\ntogether in any problem in the genome rearrangement field. Here, we define the\nproblem of sorting genomes (or permutations) using inversions whose costs are\nassigned based on their lengths and asymmetries.

Epub\n2015 Dec 9.\n\nObtaining long 16S rDNA sequences using multiple primers and its application on\ndioxin-containing samples.\n\nChen YL, Lee CC, Lin YL, Yin KM, Ho CL, Liu T.\n\nBACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has transformed\nmetagenomics because the high-throughput data allow an in-depth exploration of a \ncomplex microbial community. However, accurate species identification with NGS\ndata is challenging because NGS sequences are relatively short. Assembling 16S\nrDNA segments into longer sequences has been proposed for improving species\nidentification. Current approaches, however, either suffer from amplification\nbias due to one single primer or insufficient 16S rDNA reads in whole genome\nsequencing data.\nRESULTS: Multiple primers were used to amplify different 16S rDNA segments for\n454 sequencing, followed by 454 read classification and assembly. This permitted \ntargeted sequencing while reducing primer bias. For test samples containing four \nknown bacteria, accurate and near full-length 16S rDNAs of three known bacteria\nwere obtained. For real soil and sediment samples containing dioxins in various\nconcentrations, 16S rDNA sequences were lengthened by 50% for about half of the\nnon-rare microbes, and 16S rDNAs of several microbes reached more than 1000 bp.\nIn addition, reduced primer bias using multiple primers was illustrated.\nCONCLUSIONS: A new experimental and computational pipeline for obtaining long 16S\nrDNA sequences was proposed. The capability of the pipeline was validated on test\nsamples and illustrated on real samples. For dioxin-containing samples, the\npipeline revealed several microbes suitable for future studies of dioxin\nchemistry.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S18-S13 \nPMCID: PMC4682383\nPMID: 26681335  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The challenge is that only a\nsmall fraction of the surface residues of an antigen are confirmed as antigenic\nresidues (positive training data); the remaining residues are unlabeled. As some \nof these uncertain residues can possibly be grouped to form novel but currently\nunknown epitopes, it is misguided to unanimously classify all the unlabeled\nresidues as negative training data following the traditional supervised learning \nscheme.\nRESULTS: We propose a positive-unlabeled learning algorithm to address this\nproblem. The key idea is to distinguish between epitope-likely residues and\nreliable negative residues in unlabeled data. The method has two steps: (1)\nidentify reliable negative residues using a weighted SVM with a high recall; and \n(2) construct a classification model on the positive residues and the reliable\nnegative residues. Complex-based 10-fold cross-validation was conducted to show\nthat this method outperforms those commonly used predictors DiscoTope 2.0,\nElliPro and SEPPA 2.0 in every aspect. We conducted four case studies, in which\nthe approach was tested on antigens of West Nile virus, dihydrofolate reductase, \nbeta-lactamase, and two Ebola antigens whose epitopes are currently unknown. All \nthe results were assessed on a newly-established data set of antigen structures\nnot bound by antibodies, instead of on antibody-bound antigen structures. These\nbound structures may contain unfair binding information such as bound-state\nB-factors and protrusion index which could exaggerate the epitope prediction\nperformance.

We assume deletion events excise a geometrically\ndistributed number of consecutive genes with mean µ ≥ 1, and these events can\ncombine to produce single-copy runs of length l. If µ = 1, the process is\ngene-by-gene. If µ > 1, the process at least occasionally excises more than one\ngene at a time. In the latter case if deletions overlap, the later one simply\nextends the existing run of single-copy genes. We explore aspects of the\npredicted distribution of the lengths of single-copy regions analytically, but\nresort to simulations to show how observing run lengths l allows us to\ndiscriminate between the two hypotheses.\nCONCLUSIONS: Deletion run length distributions can discriminate between\ngene-by-gene fractionation and deletion of segments of geometrically distributed \nlength, even if µ is only slightly larger than 1, as long as the genome is large \nenough and fractionation has not proceeded too far towards completion.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S17-S9 \nPMCID: PMC4674901\nPMID: 26680009  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

These networks model interactions between\nmolecules in each cell. A large volume of research has been done to uncover\ndifferent characteristics of biological networks, such as large-scale\norganization, node centrality and network robustness. Nevertheless, the vast\nmajority of research done in this area assume that biological networks have\ndeterministic topologies. Biological interactions are however probabilistic\nevents that may or may not appear at different cells or even in the same cell at \ndifferent times.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we present novel methods for characterizing probabilistic\nsignaling networks. Our methods do this by computing the probability that a\nsignal propagates successfully from receptor to reporter genes through\ninteractions in the network. We characterize such networks with respect to (i)\ncentrality of individual nodes, (ii) stability of the entire network, and (iii)\nimportant functions served by the network. We use these methods to characterize\nmajor H. sapiens signaling networks including Wnt, ErbB and MAPK.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S17-S6 \nPMCID: PMC4674881\nPMID: 26679404  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The advent of high throughput\nmicroarray technology has enabled comprehensive monitoring of transcriptional\nresponse associated with various disease states and drug treatments.

Several computational\nmethods have been proposed in the literature that make use of publicly available \ntranscriptional data to reposition drugs against diseases.\nMETHOD: In this work, we carry out a data mining process using publicly available\ngene expression data sets associated with a few diseases and drugs, to identify\nthe existing drugs that can be used to treat genes causing lung cancer and breast\ncancer.\nRESULTS: Three strong candidates for repurposing have been identified- Letrozole \nand GDC-0941 against lung cancer, and Ribavirin against breast cancer.

Since a query compound is an important\nstarting point for the new drug, a query holder, who is afraid of the query being\nmonitored by the database server, usually downloads all the records in the\ndatabase and uses them in a closed network. However, a serious dilemma arises\nwhen the database holder also wants to output no information except for the\nsearch results, and such a dilemma prevents the use of many important data\nresources.\nRESULTS: In order to overcome this dilemma, we developed a novel cryptographic\nprotocol that enables database searching while keeping both the query holder's\nprivacy and database holder's privacy. Generally, the application of\ncryptographic techniques to practical problems is difficult because versatile\ntechniques are computationally expensive while computationally inexpensive\ntechniques can perform only trivial computation tasks. In this study, our\nprotocol is successfully built only from an additive-homomorphic cryptosystem,\nwhich allows only addition performed on encrypted values but is computationally\nefficient compared with versatile techniques such as general purpose multi-party \ncomputation. In an experiment searching ChEMBL, which consists of more than\n1,200,000 compounds, the proposed method was 36,900 times faster in CPU time and \n12,000 times as efficient in communication size compared with general purpose\nmulti-party computation.\nCONCLUSION: We proposed a novel privacy-preserving protocol for searching\nchemical compound databases. The proposed method, easily scaling for large-scale \ndatabases, may help to accelerate drug discovery research by making full use of\nunused but valuable data that includes sensitive information.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S18-S6 \nPMCID: PMC4704467\nPMID: 26678650  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a class of\nsmall, non-coding RNAs that attract great attention because of their role in\nregulation of processes such as cellular growth, proliferation, apoptosis.\nBecause of the thousands of potential interactions between a single miR and\ntarget mRNAs, bioinformatics prediction tools are very useful to facilitate the\ntask for individuating and selecting putative target genes. In this study, we\npresent a chemically-induced HCC mouse model to identify differential expression \nof miRNAs during the progression of the hepatic injury up to HCC onset. In\naddition, we describe an established bioinformatics approach to highlight\nputative target genes and protein interaction networks where they are involved.\nRESULTS: We describe four miRs (miR-125a-5p, miR-27a, miR-182, miR-193b) which\nshowed to be differentially expressed in the chemically-induced HCC mouse model. \nThe miRs were subjected to four of the most used predictions tools and 15\npredicted target genes were identified. The expression of one (ANK3) among the 15\npredicted targets was further validated by immunoblotting. Then, enrichment\nannotation analysis was performed revealing significant clusters, including some \nplaying a role in ion transporter activity, regulation of receptor protein\nserine/threonine kinase signaling pathway, protein import into nucleus,\nregulation of intracellular protein transport, regulation of cell adhesion,\ngrowth factor binding, and regulation of TGF-beta/SMAD signaling pathway. A\nnetwork construction was created and links between the selected miRs, the\npredicted targets as well as the possible interactions among them and other\nproteins were built up.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, we combined miRNA expression analysis, obtained by an\nin vivo HCC mouse model, with a bioinformatics-based workflow. New genes,\npathways and protein interactions, putatively involved in HCC initiation and\nprogression, were identified and explored.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0836-1 \nPMCID: PMC4676132\nPMID: 26652480  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, both NGS data and their analysis are error-prone,\nwhich can lead to the generation of false positive (FP) SNPs. We explored the\nrelationship between FP SNPs and seven factors involved in mapping-based variant \ncalling - quality of the reference sequence, read length, choice of mapper and\nvariant caller, mapping stringency and filtering of SNPs by read mapping quality \nand read depth. This resulted in 576 possible factor level combinations. We used \nerror- and variant-free simulated reads to ensure that every SNP found was indeed\na false positive.\nRESULTS: The variation in the number of FP SNPs generated ranged from 0 to 36,621\nfor the 120 million base pairs (Mbp) genome. All of the experimental factors\ntested had statistically significant effects on the number of FP SNPs generated\nand there was a considerable amount of interaction between the different factors.\nUsing a fragmented reference sequence led to a dramatic increase in the number of\nFP SNPs generated, as did relaxed read mapping and a lack of SNP filtering. The\nchoice of reference assembler, mapper and variant caller also significantly\naffected the outcome. The effect of read length was more complex and suggests a\npossible interaction between mapping specificity and the potential for\ncontributing more false positives as read length increases.\nCONCLUSIONS: The choice of tools and parameters involved in variant calling can\nhave a dramatic effect on the number of FP SNPs produced, with particularly poor \ncombinations of software and/or parameter settings yielding tens of thousands in \nthis experiment. Between-factor interactions make simple recommendations\ndifficult for a SNP discovery pipeline but the quality of the reference sequence \nis clearly of paramount importance. Our findings are also a stark reminder that\nit can be unwise to use the relaxed mismatch settings provided as defaults by\nsome read mappers when reads are being mapped to a relatively unfinished\nreference sequence from e.g. a non-model organism in its early stages of genomic \nexploration.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0801-z \nPMCID: PMC4642669\nPMID: 26558718  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the functions of most plant miRNAs remain unknown.\nInferring these functions from miRNA functional similarity would thus be useful. \nThis study proposes a new method, called PPImiRFS, for inferring miRNA functional\nsimilarity.\nRESULTS: The functional similarity of miRNAs was inferred from the functional\nsimilarity of their target gene sets. A protein-protein interaction network with \nsemantic similarity weights of edges generated using Gene Ontology terms was\nconstructed to infer the functional similarity between two target genes that\nbelong to two different miRNAs, and the score for functional similarity was\ncalculated using the weighted shortest path for the two target genes through the \nwhole network. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was more \neffective and reliable than previous methods (miRFunSim and GOSemSim) applied to \nArabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, miRNAs responding to the same type of stress \nhad higher functional similarity than miRNAs responding to different types of\nstress.\nCONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a protein-protein interaction network with\nsemantic similarity weights generated using Gene Ontology terms was employed to\ncalculate the functional similarity of plant miRNAs. A novel method based on\ncalculating the weighted shortest path between two target genes was introduced.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0789-4 \nPMCID: PMC4634583\nPMID: 26538106  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

While the\njudicious use of supplementary material can improve the readability of scientific\narticles, its excessive use threatens the scientific review process and by\nextension the integrity of the scientific literature. In many cases supplementary\nmaterial today is so extensive that it is reviewed superficially or not at all.\nFurthermore, citations buried within supplementary files rob other scientists of \nrecognition of their contribution to the scientific record. These issues are\nexacerbated by the lack of guidance on the use of supplementary information from \nthe journals to authors and reviewers. We propose that the removal of artificial \nlength restrictions plus the use of interactive features made possible by modern \nelectronic media can help to alleviate these problems. Many journals, in fact,\nhave already removed article length limitations (as is the case for BMC\nBioinformatics and other BioMed Central journals).

Several\nexisting genotype imputation methods can be efficient for this purpose, while\nachieving various levels of imputation accuracy. Recent empirical results have\nshown that the two-step imputation may improve accuracy by imputing the low\ndensity genotyped study animals to a medium density array first and then to the\ntarget density. We are interested in building a series of staircase arrays that\nlead the low density array to the high density array or even the whole genome,\nsuch that genotype imputation along these staircases can achieve the highest\naccuracy.\nRESULTS: For genotype imputation from a lower density to a higher density, we\nfirst show how to select untyped SNPs to construct a medium density array.\nSubsequently, we determine for each selected SNP those untyped SNPs to be imputed\nin the add-one two-step imputation, and lastly how the clusters of imputed\ngenotype are pieced together as the final imputation result. We design extensive \nempirical experiments using several hundred sequenced and genotyped animals to\ndemonstrate that our novel two-step piecemeal imputation always achieves an\nimprovement compared to the one-step imputation by the state-of-the-art methods\nBeagle and FImpute. Using the two-step piecemeal imputation, we present some\npreliminary success on whole genome SNP genotype imputation for genotyped animals\nvia a series of staircase arrays.\nCONCLUSIONS: From a low SNP density to the whole genome, intermediate\npseudo-arrays can be computationally constructed by selecting the most\ninformative SNPs for untyped SNP genotype imputation. Such pseudo-array\nstaircases are able to impute more accurately than the classic one-step\nimputation.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0770-2 \nPMCID: PMC4619096\nPMID: 26498158  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we investigate how comparative\ngenomics can be utilized for the prediction of microbial phenotypes. The PICA\nframework facilitates application and comparison of different machine learning\ntechniques for phenotypic trait prediction. We have improved and extended PICA's \nsupport vector machine plug-in and suggest its applicability to large-scale\ngenome databases and incomplete genome sequences. We have demonstrated the\nstability of the predictive power for phenotypic traits, not perturbed by the\nrapid growth of genome databases. A new software tool facilitates the in-depth\nanalysis of phenotype models, which associate expected and unexpected protein\nfunctions with particular traits. Most of the traits can be reliably predicted in\nonly 60-70% complete genomes. We have established a new phenotypic model that\npredicts intracellular microorganisms. Thereby we could demonstrate that also\nindependently evolved phenotypic traits, characterized by genome reduction, can\nbe reliably predicted based on comparative genomics.

This approach expands an arena, and thus allows\nfurther study of biological functions in the field of network biology. As the\nclustering algorithms that are currently employed in finding modules have innate \nuncertainties, external and internal validations are necessary.\nMETHODS: Sequence and network structure alignment, has been used to define the\nInterlog Protein Network (IPN). This network is an evolutionarily conserved\nnetwork with communal nodes and less false-positive links. In the current study, \nthe IPN is employed as an evolution-based benchmark in the validation of the\nmodule finding methods. The clustering results of five algorithms; Markov\nClustering (MCL), Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering (RNSC), Cartographic \nRepresentation (CR), Laplacian Dynamics (LD) and Genetic Algorithm; to find\ncommunities in Protein-Protein Interaction networks (GAPPI) are assessed by IPN\nin four distinct Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PPINs).\nRESULTS: The MCL shows a more accurate algorithm based on this evolutionary\nbenchmarking approach. Also, the biological relevance of proteins in the IPN\nmodules generated by MCL is compatible with biological standard databases such as\nGene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, the IPN shows its potential for validation of\nclustering algorithms due to its biological logic and straightforward\nimplementation.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0755-1 \nPMCID: PMC4595048\nPMID: 26437714  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Patients\ncarrying certain HLA alleles may develop adverse drug reactions (ADRs) after\ntaking specific drugs. Peptides play an important role in HLA related ADRs as\nthey are the necessary co-binders of HLAs with drugs. Many experimental data have\nbeen generated for understanding HLA-peptide binding. However, efficiently\nutilizing the data for understanding and accurately predicting HLA-peptide\nbinding is challenging. Therefore, we developed a network analysis based method\nto understand and predict HLA-peptide binding.\nMETHODS: Qualitative Class I HLA-peptide binding data were harvested and prepared\nfrom four major databases. An HLA-peptide binding network was constructed from\nthis dataset and modules were identified by the fast greedy modularity\noptimization algorithm. To examine the significance of signals in the yielded\nmodels, the modularity was compared with the modularity values generated from\n1,000 random networks. The peptides and HLAs in the modules were characterized by\nsimilarity analysis. The neighbor-edges based and unbiased leverage algorithm\n(Nebula) was developed for predicting HLA-peptide binding. Leave-one-out (LOO)\nvalidations and two-fold cross-validations were conducted to evaluate the\nperformance of Nebula using the constructed HLA-peptide binding network.\nRESULTS: Nine modules were identified from analyzing the HLA-peptide binding\nnetwork with a highest modularity compared to all the random networks. Peptide\nlength and functional side chains of amino acids at certain positions of the\npeptides were different among the modules. HLA sequences were module dependent to\nsome extent. Nebula archived an overall prediction accuracy of 0.816 in the LOO\nvalidations and average accuracy of 0.795 in the two-fold cross-validations and\noutperformed the method reported in the literature.\nCONCLUSIONS: Network analysis is a useful approach for analyzing large and sparse\ndatasets such as the HLA-peptide binding dataset. The modules identified from the\nnetwork analysis clustered peptides and HLAs with similar sequences and\nproperties of amino acids. Nebula performed well in the predictions of\nHLA-peptide binding. We demonstrated that network analysis coupled with Nebula is\nan efficient approach to understand and predict HLA-peptide binding interactions \nand thus, could further our understanding of ADRs.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S13-S9 \nPMCID: PMC4597169\nPMID: 26424483  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In enteroviruses, a clear understanding of\nthe characteristics of tree topology, transmission, and its demographic dynamics \nin viral succession and circulation are essential for identifying prevalence\ntrends in endemic pathogens such as coxsackievirus B2 (CV-B2). This study applied\na novel Bayesian evolutionary approach to elucidate the phylodynamic\ncharacteristics of CV-B2. A dataset containing 51 VP1 sequences and a dataset\ncontaining 34 partial 3D(pol) sequencing were analyzed, where each dataset\nincluded Taiwan sequences isolated during 1988-2013.\nRESULTS: Four and five genotypes were determined based on the 846-nucleotide VP1 \nand 441-nucleotide 3D(pol) (6641-7087) regions, respectively, with\nspatiotemporally structured topologies in both trees. Some strains with tree\ndiscordance indicated the occurrence of recombination in the region between the\nVP1 and 3D(pol) genes. The similarities of VP1 and 3D(pol) gene were 80.0%-96.8% \nand 74.7%-91.9%, respectively. Analyses of population dynamics using VP1 dataset \nindicated that the endemic CV-B2 has a small effective population size. The\nbalance indices, high similarity, and low evolutionary rate in the VP1 region\nindicated mild herd immunity selection in the major capsid region.\nCONCLUSIONS: Phylodynamic analysis can reveal demographic trends and herd\nimmunity in endemic pathogens.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0738-2 \nPMCID: PMC4578604\nPMID: 26390997  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

For\nhigh-dimensional prediction models (the number of variables greatly exceeds the\nnumber of samples) the choice of an appropriate classifier is crucial as it was\nobserved that no single classification algorithm performs optimally for all types\nof data. Boosting was proposed as a method that combines the classification\nresults obtained using base classifiers, where the sample weights are\nsequentially adjusted based on the performance in previous iterations. Generally \nboosting outperforms any individual classifier, but studies with high-dimensional\ndata showed that the most standard boosting algorithm, AdaBoost.M1, cannot\nsignificantly improve the performance of its base classier. Recently other\nboosting algorithms were proposed (Gradient boosting, Stochastic Gradient\nboosting, LogitBoost); they were shown to perform better than AdaBoost.M1 but\ntheir performance was not evaluated for high-dimensional data.\nRESULTS: In this paper we use simulation studies and real gene-expression data\nsets to evaluate the performance of boosting algorithms when data are\nhigh-dimensional. Our results confirm that AdaBoost.M1 can perform poorly in this\nsetting, often failing to improve the performance of its base classifier. We\nprovide the explanation for this and propose a modification, AdaBoost.M1.ICV,\nwhich uses cross-validated estimates of the prediction errors and outperforms the\noriginal algorithm when data are high-dimensional. The use of AdaBoost.M1.ICV is \nadvisable when the base classifier overfits the training data: the number of\nvariables is large, the number of samples is small, and/or the difference between\nthe classes is large. To a lesser extent also Gradient boosting suffers from\nsimilar problems. Contrary to the findings for the low-dimensional data,\nshrinkage does not improve the performance of Gradient boosting when data are\nhigh-dimensional, however it is beneficial for Stochastic Gradient boosting,\nwhich outperformed the other boosting algorithms in our analyses. LogitBoost\nsuffers from overfitting and generally performs poorly.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results show that boosting can substantially improve the\nperformance of its base classifier also when data are high-dimensional. However, \nnot all boosting algorithms perform equally well. LogitBoost, AdaBoost.M1 and\nGradient boosting seem less useful for this type of data. Overall, Stochastic\nGradient boosting with shrinkage and AdaBoost.M1.ICV seem to be the preferable\nchoices for high-dimensional class-prediction.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0723-9 \nPMCID: PMC4578758\nPMID: 26390865  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In trees, vertices may \nhave only a single parent (ancestor), while networks allow for multiple parent\nvertices. There are two main interpretive types of networks, \"softwired\" and\n\"hardwired.\" The parsimony cost of hardwired networks is based on all changes\nover all edges, hence must be greater than or equal to the best tree cost\ncontained (\"displayed\") by the network. This is in contrast to softwired, where\neach character follows the lowest parsimony cost tree displayed by the network,\nresulting in costs which are less than or equal to the best display tree. Neither\nsituation is ideal since hard-wired networks are not generally biologically\nattractive (since individual heritable characters can have more than one parent) \nand softwired networks can be trivially optimized (containing the best tree for\neach character). Furthermore, given the alternate cost scenarios of trees and\nthese two flavors of networks, hypothesis testing among these explanatory\nscenarios is impossible.\nRESULTS: A network cost adjustment (penalty) is proposed to allow phylogenetic\ntrees and soft-wired phylogenetic networks to compete equally on a parsimony\noptimality basis. This cost is demonstrated for several real and simulated\ndatasets. In each case, the favored graph representation (tree or network)\nmatched expectation or simulation scenario.\nCONCLUSIONS: The softwired network cost regime proposed here presents a\nquantitative criterion for an optimality-based search procedure where trees and\nnetworks can participate in hypothesis testing simultaneously.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0675-0 \nPMCID: PMC4574467\nPMID: 26382078  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Hence, they are\nwell suited for de novo- or re-sequencing projects. Sequences generated for these\npurposes will not only contain reads originating from the nuclear genome, but\nalso a significant amount of reads originating from the organelles of the target \norganism. These reads are usually discarded but they can also be used for an\nassembly of organellar replicons. The long read length supports resolution of\nrepetitive regions and repeats within the organelles genome which might be\nproblematic when just using short read data. Additionally, SMRT sequencing is\nless influenced by GC rich areas and by long stretches of the same base.\nRESULTS: We describe a workflow for a de novo assembly of the sugar beet (Beta\nvulgaris ssp. vulgaris) chloroplast genome sequence only based on data\noriginating from a SMRT sequencing dataset targeted on its nuclear genome. We\nshow that the data obtained from such an experiment are sufficient to create a\nhigh quality assembly with a higher reliability than assemblies derived from e.g.\nIllumina reads only. The chloroplast genome is especially challenging for de novo\nassembling as it contains two large inverted repeat (IR) regions. We also\ndescribe some limitations that still apply even though long reads are used for\nthe assembly.\nCONCLUSIONS: SMRT sequencing reads extracted from a dataset created for nuclear\ngenome (re)sequencing can be used to obtain a high quality de novo assembly of\nthe chloroplast of the sequenced organism. Even with a relatively small overall\ncoverage for the nuclear genome it is possible to collect more than enough reads \nto generate a high quality assembly that outperforms short read based assemblies.\nHowever, even with long reads it is not always possible to clarify the order of\nelements of a chloroplast genome sequence reliantly which we could demonstrate\nwith Fosmid End Sequences (FES) generated with Sanger technology. Nevertheless,\nthis limitation also applies to short read sequencing data but is reached in this\ncase at a much earlier stage during finishing.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0726-6 \nPMCID: PMC4573686\nPMID: 26377912  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A specific aim of the work involves developing a clinically\nuseful screening tool that could yield accurate assessments of disease state such\nas the risk or presence of SSc-ILD, the activity of lung involvement and the\nlikelihood to respond to therapeutic intervention. Ultimately this instrument\ncould facilitate a refined stratification of SSc patients into clinically\nrelevant subsets at the time of diagnosis and subsequently during the course of\nthe disease and thus help in preventing bad outcomes from disease progression or \nunnecessary treatment side effects. The methods utilized in the work involve: (1)\nclinical and peripheral blood flow cytometry data (Immune Response In\nScleroderma, IRIS) from consented patients followed at the Johns Hopkins\nScleroderma Center. (2) machine learning (Conditional Random Forests - CRF)\ncoupled with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify subsets of FC\nvariables that are highly effective in classifying ILD patients; and (3)\nstochastic simulation to design, train and validate ILD risk screening tools.\nRESULTS: Our hybrid analysis approach (CRF-GSEA) proved successful in predicting \nSSc patient ILD status with a high degree of success (>82% correct classification\nin validation; 79 patients in the training data set, 40 patients in the\nvalidation data set).\nCONCLUSIONS: IRIS flow cytometry data provides useful information in assessing\nthe ILD status of SSc patients. Our new approach combining Conditional Random\nForests and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was successful in identifying a subset\nof flow cytometry variables to create a screening tool that proved effective in\ncorrectly identifying ILD patients in the training and validation data sets. From\na somewhat broader perspective, the identification of subsets of flow cytometry\nvariables that exhibit coordinated movement (i.e., multi-variable up or down\nregulation) may lead to insights into possible effector pathways and thereby\nimprove the state of knowledge of systemic sclerosis pathogenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0722-x \nPMCID: PMC4571079\nPMID: 26373409  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Predictive\ntools for swine and other food animals are not as well developed, primarily\nbecause the data required to develop the tools are lacking. Here, we overcome a\nlack of T cell epitope data to construct swine epitope predictors by\nsystematically leveraging available human information. Applying the \"pocket\nprofile method\", we use sequence and structural similarities in the binding\npockets of human and swine major histocompatibility complex proteins to infer\nSwine Leukocyte Antigen (SLA) peptide binding preferences. We developed\nepitope-prediction matrices (PigMatrices), for three SLA class I alleles\n(SLA-1*0401, 2*0401 and 3*0401) and one class II allele (SLA-DRB1*0201), based on\nthe binding preferences of the best-matched Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) pocket \nfor each SLA pocket. The contact residues involved in the binding pockets were\ndefined for class I based on crystal structures of either SLA (SLA-specific\ncontacts, Ssc) or HLA supertype alleles (HLA contacts, Hc); for class II, only Hc\nwas possible. Different substitution matrices were evaluated (PAM and BLOSUM) for\nscoring pocket similarity and identifying the best human match. The accuracy of\nthe PigMatrices was compared to available online swine epitope prediction tools\nsuch as PickPocket and NetMHCpan.\nRESULTS: PigMatrices that used Ssc to define the pocket sequences and PAM30 to\nscore pocket similarity demonstrated the best predictive performance and were\nable to accurately separate binders from random peptides. For SLA-1*0401 and\n2*0401, PigMatrix achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurves (AUC) of 0.78 and 0.73, respectively, which were equivalent or better than\nPickPocket (0.76 and 0.54) and NetMHCpan version 2.4 (0.41 and 0.51) and version \n2.8 (0.72 and 0.71). In addition, we developed the first predictive SLA class II \nmatrix, obtaining an AUC of 0.73 for existing SLA-DRB1*0201 epitopes. Notably,\nPigMatrix achieved this level of predictive power without training on SLA binding\ndata.\nCONCLUSION: Overall, the pocket profile method combined with binding preferences \nfrom HLA binding data shows significant promise for developing T cell epitope\nprediction tools for pigs. When combined with existing vaccine design algorithms,\nPigMatrix will be useful for developing genome-derived vaccines for a range of\npig pathogens for which no effective vaccines currently exist (e.g. porcine\nreproductive and respiratory syndrome, influenza and porcine epidemic diarrhea).\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0724-8 \nPMCID: PMC4570239\nPMID: 26370412  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Splicing decisions are affected by the \ncombinatorial behavior of different splicing factors that bind to multiple\nbinding sites in exons and introns. These binding sites are called splicing\nregulatory elements (SREs). Here we develop CoSREM (Combinatorial SRE Miner), a\ngraph mining algorithm to discover combinatorial SREs in human exons. Our model\ndoes not assume a fixed length of SREs and incorporates experimental evidence as \nwell to increase accuracy. CoSREM is able to identify sets of SREs and is not\nlimited to SRE pairs as are current approaches.\nRESULTS: We identified 37 SRE sets that include both enhancer and silencer\nelements. We show that our results intersect with previous results, including\nsome that are experimental. We also show that the SRE set GGGAGG and GAGGAC\nidentified by CoSREM may play a role in exon skipping events in several tumor\nsamples. We applied CoSREM to RNA-Seq data for multiple tissues to identify\ncombinatorial SREs which may be responsible for exon inclusion or exclusion\nacross tissues.\nCONCLUSION: The new algorithm can identify different combinations of splicing\nenhancers and silencers without assuming a predefined size or limiting the\nalgorithm to find only pairs of SREs. Our approach opens new directions to study \nSREs and the roles that AS may play in diseases and tissue specificity.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0698-6 \nPMCID: PMC4559876\nPMID: 26337677  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

High-throughput experimental\ntechniques have produced a large amount of protein interactions, which makes it\npossible to predict protein complexes from protein-protein interaction (PPI)\nnetworks. However, the small amount of known physical interactions may limit\nprotein complex detection.\nMETHODS: The new PPI networks are constructed by integrating PPI datasets with\nthe large and readily available PPI data from biomedical literature, and then the\nless reliable PPI between two proteins are filtered out based on semantic\nsimilarity and topological similarity of the two proteins. Finally, the\nsupervised learning protein complex detection (SLPC), which can make full use of \nthe information of available known complexes, is applied to detect protein\ncomplex on the new PPI networks.\nRESULTS: The experimental results of SLPC on two different categories yeast PPI\nnetworks demonstrate effectiveness of the approach: compared with the original\nPPI networks, the best average improvements of 4.76, 6.81 and 15.75 percentage\nunits in the F-score, accuracy and maximum matching ratio (MMR) are achieved\nrespectively; compared with the denoising PPI networks, the best average\nimprovements of 3.91, 4.61 and 12.10 percentage units in the F-score, accuracy\nand MMR are achieved respectively; compared with ClusterONE, the start-of the-art\ncomplex detection method, on the denoising extended PPI networks, the average\nimprovements of 26.02 and 22.40 percentage units in the F-score and MMR are\nachieved respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The experimental results show that the performances of SLPC have a\nlarge improvement through integration of new receivable PPI data from biomedical \nliterature into original PPI networks and denoising PPI networks.

Three basic models (the statistical regression model, the K nearest\nneighbor model and the modified version of the back propagation neural network)\nin CCM operate sequentially in close collaboration with each other, employing the\nestimated value obtained from the afore-positioned base model as an input value\nto the next-positioned base model in the cascade. The effects of various\nparameters on the pharmacological efficacy of a female controlled drug delivery\nsystem (FcDDS) intended for prevention of women from HIV-1 infection were\nevaluated using an in vitro apparatus \"Simulant Vaginal System\" (SVS). We used\ncomputer simulations to explicitly examine the changes in drug diffusivity from\nFcDDS and determine the prognostic potency of each variable for in vivo\nprediction of formulation efficacy. The results obtained using the CCM approach\nwere compared with those from individual multiple regression model.\nRESULTS: CCM significantly lowered the percentage mean error (PME) and enhanced\nr(2) values as compared with those from the multiple regression models. It was\nnoted that CCM generated the PME value of 21.82 at 48169 epoch iterations, which \nis significantly improved from the PME value of 29.91% at 118344 epochs by the\nback propagation network model. The results of this study indicated that the\nsequential ensemble of the classifiers allowed for an accurate prediction of the \ndomain with significantly lowered variance and considerably reduces the time\nrequired for training phase.\nCONCLUSION: CCM is accurate, easy to operate, time and cost-effective, and thus, \ncan serve as a valuable tool for prediction of drug diffusivity from mucoadhesive\nformulations. CCM may yield new insights into understanding how drugs are\ndiffused from the carrier systems and exert their efficacies under various\nclinical conditions.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0684-z \nPMCID: PMC4545320\nPMID: 26286552  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This finding lends support to the theory that CGRs \nof genomic sequences can act as graphic genomic signatures. In particular, we\ncompare the CGR patterns of over five hundred different 150,000 bp genomic\nsequences spanning one complete chromosome from each of six organisms,\nrepresenting all kingdoms of life: H. sapiens (Animalia; chromosome 21), S.\ncerevisiae (Fungi; chromosome 4), A. thaliana (Plantae; chromosome 1), P.\nfalciparum (Protista; chromosome 14), E. coli (Bacteria - full genome), and P.\nfuriosus (Archaea - full genome). To maximize the diversity within each species, \nwe also analyze the interrelationships within a set of over five hundred 150,000 \nbp genomic sequences sampled from the entire aforementioned genomes. Lastly, we\nprovide some preliminary evidence of this method's ability to classify genomic\nDNA sequences at lower taxonomic levels by comparing sequences sampled from the\nentire genome of H. sapiens (class Mammalia, order Primates) and of M. musculus\n(class Mammalia, order Rodentia), for a total length of approximately 174 million\nbasepairs analyzed. We compute pairwise distances between CGRs of these genomic\nsequences using six different distances, and construct Molecular Distance Maps,\nwhich visualize all sequences as points in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional\nspace, to simultaneously display their interrelationships.\nCONCLUSION: Our analysis confirms, for this dataset, that CGR patterns of DNA\nsequences from the same genome are in general quantitatively similar, while being\ndifferent for DNA sequences from genomes of different species. Our assessment of \nthe performance of the six distances analyzed uses three different quality\nmeasures and suggests that several distances outperform the Euclidean distance,\nwhich has so far been almost exclusively used for such studies.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0655-4 \nPMCID: PMC4527362\nPMID: 26249837  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, a principal challenge\nremains in obtaining a significant amount of recall. We argue that this is an\nimportant quality for Information Extraction tasks in this field. We propose a\nsemi-supervised framework, leveraging a large corpus of unannotated data\navailable to us. In this framework, the annotated data is used to find plausible \ncandidates for positive data points, which are included in the machine learning\nprocess. As this is a method principally designed for gaining recall, we further \nexplore additional methods to improve precision on top of this. These are:\nweighted regularisation in the SVM framework, and filtering out unlabelled\nexamples based on a probabilistic rule-finding method. The latter method also\nallows us to add candidates for negatives from unlabelled data, a method not\nviable in the unfiltered approach.\nRESULTS: We replicate one of the original participant systems, and modify it to\nincorporate our methods. This allows us to test the extent of our proposed\nmethods by applying them to the GRN task data. We find a considerable improvement\nin recall compared to the baseline system. We also investigate the evaluation\nmetrics and find several mechanisms explaining a bias towards precision.\nFurthermore, these findings uncover an intricate precision-recall interaction,\ndepriving recall of its habitual immediacy seen in traditional machine learning\nset-ups.\nCONCLUSION: Our contributions are twofold.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S10-S4 \nPMCID: PMC4511406\nPMID: 26202824  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Nowadays, these documents \nare mainly available in the form of unstructured free texts, which require heavy \nprocessing for their registration into organized databases. This organization is \ninstrumental for information retrieval, enabling to answer the advanced queries\nof researchers and practitioners in biology, medicine, and related fields. Hence,\nthe massive data flow calls for efficient automatic methods of text-mining that\nextract high-level information, such as biomedical events, from biomedical text. \nThe usual computational tools of Natural Language Processing cannot be readily\napplied to extract these biomedical events, due to the peculiarities of the\ndomain. Indeed, biomedical documents contain highly domain-specific jargon and\nsyntax. These documents also describe distinctive dependencies, making\ntext-mining in molecular biology a specific discipline.\nRESULTS: We address biomedical event extraction as the classification of pairs of\ntext entities into the classes corresponding to event types. The candidate pairs \nof text entities are recursively provided to a multiclass classifier relying on\nSupport Vector Machines. This recursive process extracts events involving other\nevents as arguments. Compared to joint models based on Markov Random Fields, our \nmodel simplifies inference and hence requires shorter training and prediction\ntimes along with lower memory capacity. Compared to usual pipeline approaches,\nour model passes over a complex intermediate problem, while making a more\nextensive usage of sophisticated joint features between text entities. Our method\nfocuses on the core event extraction of the Genia task of BioNLP challenges\nyielding the best result reported so far on the 2013 edition.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S10-S8 \nPMCID: PMC4511465\nPMID: 26201478  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epub\n2015 Jul 13.\n\nThe contribution of co-reference resolution to supervised relation detection\nbetween bacteria and biotopes entities.\n\nLavergne T, Grouin C, Zweigenbaum P.\n\nBACKGROUND: The acquisition of knowledge about relations between bacteria and\ntheir locations (habitats and geographical locations) in short texts about\nbacteria, as defined in the BioNLP-ST 2013 Bacteria Biotope task, depends on the \ndetection of co-reference links between mentions of entities of each of these\nthree types. To our knowledge, no participant in this task has investigated this \naspect of the situation. The present work specifically addresses issues raised by\nthis situation: (i) how to detect these co-reference links and associated\nco-reference chains; (ii) how to use them to prepare positive and negative\nexamples to train a supervised system for the detection of relations between\nentity mentions; (iii) what context around which entity mentions contributes to\nrelation detection when co-reference chains are provided.\nRESULTS: We present experiments and results obtained both with gold entity\nmentions (task 2 of BioNLP-ST 2013) and with automatically detected entity\nmentions (end-to-end system, in task 3 of BioNLP-ST 2013). Our supervised mention\ndetection system uses a linear chain Conditional Random Fields classifier, and\nour relation detection system relies on a Logistic Regression (aka Maximum\nEntropy) classifier. They use a set of morphological, morphosyntactic and\nsemantic features. To minimize false inferences, co-reference resolution applies \na set of heuristic rules designed to optimize precision. They take into account\nthe types of the detected entity mentions, and take advantage of the didactic\nnature of the texts of the corpus, where a large proportion of bacteria naming is\nfairly explicit (although natural referring expressions such as \"the bacteria\"\nare common). The resulting system achieved a 0.495 F-measure on the official test\nset when taking as input the gold entity mentions, and a 0.351 F-measure when\ntaking as input entity mentions predicted by our CRF system, both of which are\nabove the best BioNLP-ST 2013 participant system.\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that co-reference resolution substantially improves over a\nbaseline system which does not use co-reference information: about 3.5 F-measure \npoints on the test corpus for the end-to-end system (5.5 points on the\ndevelopment corpus) and 7 F-measure points on both development and test corpora\nwhen gold mentions are used. While this outperforms the best published system on \nthe BioNLP-ST 2013 Bacteria Biotope dataset, we consider that it provides mostly \na stronger baseline from which more work can be started. We also emphasize the\nimportance and difficulty of designing a comprehensive gold standard co-reference\nannotation, which we explain is a key point to further progress on the task.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S10-S6 \nPMCID: PMC4511182\nPMID: 26201352  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A major challenge is to design an\neffective method that eliminates irrelevant, redundant, or noisy genes from the\nclassification, while retaining all of the highly discriminative genes.\nRESULTS: We propose a gene selection method, called local hyperplane-based\ndiscriminant analysis (LHDA). LHDA adopts two central ideas. First, it uses a\nlocal approximation rather than global measurement; second, it embeds a recently \nreported classification model, K-Local Hyperplane Distance Nearest Neighbor(HKNN)\nclassifier, into its discriminator. Through classification accuracy-based\niterations, LHDA obtains the feature weight vector and finally extracts the\noptimal feature subset. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in\nextensive experiments on synthetic and real microarray benchmark datasets. Eight \nclassical feature selection methods, four classification models and two popular\nembedded learning schemes, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), hyperplane\nk-nearest neighbor (HKNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest are\nemployed for comparisons.\nCONCLUSION: The proposed method yielded comparable to or superior performances to\nseven state-of-the-art models.

Instead of doing all possible experiments in a given domain, active\nlearning can be used to pick the experiments that will add the most knowledge to \nthe current model. Especially, for drug discovery and development, active\nlearning has been shown to reduce the number of experiments needed to obtain\nhigh-confidence predictions. However, in practice, it is crucial to have a method\nto evaluate the quality of the current predictions and decide when to stop the\nexperimentation process. Only by applying reliable stopping criteria to active\nlearning can time and costs in the experimental process actually be saved.\nRESULTS: We compute active learning traces on simulated drug-target matrices in\norder to determine a regression model for the accuracy of the active learner. By \nanalyzing the performance of the regression model on simulated data, we design\nstopping criteria for previously unseen experimental matrices. We demonstrate on \nfour previously characterized drug effect data sets that applying the stopping\ncriteria can result in upto 40 % savings of the total experiments for highly\naccurate predictions.\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that active learning accuracy can be predicted using\nsimulated data and results in substantial savings in the number of experiments\nrequired to make accurate drug-target predictions.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0650-9 \nPMCID: PMC4495685\nPMID: 26153434  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

To\nachieve this task we have to understand biological networks based on\nprotein-protein interactions. Bioinformatics has come up with a great amount of\ndatabases and tools that support analysts in exploring protein-protein\ninteractions on an integrated level for knowledge discovery. They provide\npredictions and correlations, indicate possibilities for future experimental\nresearch and fill the gaps to complete the picture of biochemical processes.\nThere are numerous and huge databases of protein-protein interactions used to\ngain insights into answering some of the many questions of systems biology. Many \ncomputational resources integrate interaction data with additional information on\nmolecular background. However, the vast number of diverse Bioinformatics\nresources poses an obstacle to the goal of understanding. We present a survey of \ndatabases that enable the visual analysis of protein networks.\nRESULTS: We selected M=10 out of N=53 resources supporting visualization, and we \ntested against the following set of criteria: interoperability, data integration,\nquantity of possible interactions, data visualization quality and data coverage. \nThe study reveals differences in usability, visualization features and quality as\nwell as the quantity of interactions.

In this open framework it has been suggested\nthat the ligand stabilizes the interaction of the distal \"kissing loop\" complex. \nUsing accurate full-atom molecular dynamics with explicit solvent in combination \nwith enhanced sampling techniques and advanced analysis methods it could be\npossible to provide a more detailed perspective on the formation of these\ntertiary contacts.\nMETHODS: In this work, we used umbrella sampling simulations to study the\nthermodynamics of the kissing loop complex in the presence and in the absence of \nthe cognate ligand. We enforced the breaking/formation of the loop-loop\ninteraction restraining the distance between the two loops. We also assessed the \nconvergence of the results by using two alternative initialization protocols. A\nstructural analysis was performed using a novel approach to analyze base\ncontacts.\nRESULTS: Contacts between the two loops were progressively lost when larger\ninter-loop distances were enforced. Inter-loop Watson-Crick contacts survived at \nlarger separation when compared with non-canonical pairing and stacking\ninteractions. Intra-loop stacking contacts remained formed upon loop undocking.\nOur simulations qualitatively indicated that the ligand could stabilize the\nkissing loop complex. We also compared with previously published simulation\nstudies.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Kissing complex stabilization given by the ligand was\ncompatible with available experimental data. However, the dependence of its value\non the initialization protocol of the umbrella sampling simulations posed some\nquestions on the quantitative interpretation of the results and called for better\nconverged enhanced sampling simulations.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S9-S6 \nPMCID: PMC4464220\nPMID: 26051557  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This complex neurodevelopment\ndisorder is known to be associated with a combination of genetic and\nenvironmental factors. Neurexins and neuroligins play a key role in\nsynaptogenesis and neurexin-neuroligin adhesion is one of several processes that \nhave been implicated in autism spectrum disorders.\nRESULTS: In this report we describe the manual annotation of a selection of gene \nproducts known to be associated with autism and/or the neurexin-neuroligin-SHANK \ncomplex and demonstrate how a focused annotation approach leads to the creation\nof more descriptive Gene Ontology (GO) terms, as well as an increase in both the \nnumber of gene product annotations and their granularity, thus improving the data\navailable in the GO database.\nCONCLUSIONS: The manual annotations we describe will impact on the functional\nanalysis of a variety of future autism-relevant datasets. Comprehensive gene\nannotation is an essential aspect of genomic and proteomic studies, as the\nquality of gene annotations incorporated into statistical analysis tools affects \nthe effective interpretation of data obtained through genome wide association\nstudies, next generation sequencing, proteomic and transcriptomic datasets.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0622-0 \nPMCID: PMC4458007\nPMID: 26047810  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A delay in prescribing appropriate antimicrobial agent can lead \nto amputation or life threatening complications. Thus, this electronic nose\n(e-nose) technique will provide a diagnostic tool that will allow for rapid and\naccurate identification of a pathogen.\nRESULTS: This study investigates the performance of e-nose technique performing\ndirect measurement of static headspace with algorithm and data interpretations\nwhich was validated by Headspace SPME-GC-MS, to determine the causative bacteria \nresponsible for diabetic foot infection. The study was proposed to complement the\nwound swabbing method for bacterial culture and to serve as a rapid screening\ntool for bacteria species identification. The investigation focused on both\nsingle and poly microbial subjected to different agar media cultures. A\nmulti-class technique was applied including statistical approaches such as\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis (LDA) as well as neural networks called Probability Neural Network\n(PNN). Most of classifiers successfully identified poly and single microbial\nspecies with up to 90% accuracy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results obtained from this study showed that the e-nose was able\nto identify and differentiate between poly and single microbial species\ncomparable to the conventional clinical technique. It also indicates that even\nthough poly and single bacterial species in different agar solution emit\ndifferent headspace volatiles, they can still be discriminated and identified\nusing multivariate techniques.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0601-5 \nPMCID: PMC4430918\nPMID: 25971258  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Standard vocabularies for \nmass spectrometry exist and provide good coverage for most experimental\napplications yet are insufficient for concise and unambiguous description of data\nconcepts spanning the range of signal provenance from a molecular perspective\n(e.g. from charged peptides down to fine isotopes). Without a standard\nunambiguous nomenclature, literature searches, algorithm reproducibility and\nalgorithm evaluation for MS-omics data processing are nearly impossible.\nRESULTS: We show how terms from current official ontologies are too vague or\nambiguous to explicitly map molecular entities to MS signals and we illustrate\nthe inconsistency and ambiguity of current colloquially used terms. We also\npropose a set of terms for MS1 signal that uniquely, succinctly and intuitively\ndescribe data concepts spanning the range of signal provenance from full molecule\ndowns to fine isotopes. We suggest that additional community discussion of these \nterms should precede any further standardization efforts. We propose a novel\nnomenclature that spans the range of the required granularity to describe MS data\nprocessing from the perspective of the molecular provenance of the MS signal.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed nomenclature provides a chain of succinct and unique\nterms spanning the signal created by a charged molecule down through each of its \nconstituent subsignals.

Sensor-based, non-invasive and automated processes are needed to overcome \nthe phenotypic bottleneck, which limits data volumes on account of manual\nevaluations. A major challenge for sensor-based phenotyping in vineyards is the\ndistinction between the grapevine in the foreground and the field in the\nbackground - this is especially the case for red-green-blue (RGB) images, where\nsimilar color distributions occur both in the foreground plant and in the field\nand background plants. However, RGB cameras are a suitable tool in the field\nbecause they provide high-resolution data at fast acquisition rates with\nrobustness to outdoor illumination.\nRESULTS: This study presents a method to segment the phenotypic classes 'leaf',\n'stem', 'grape' and 'background' in RGB images that were taken with a standard\nconsumer camera in vineyards. Background subtraction is achieved by taking two\nimages of each plant for depth reconstruction. The color information is\nfurthermore used to distinguish the leaves from stem and grapes in the\nforeground. The presented approach allows for objective computation of phenotypic\ntraits like 3D leaf surface areas and fruit-to-leaf ratios. The method has been\nsuccessfully applied to objective assessment of growth habits of new breeding\nlines. To this end, leaf areas of two breeding lines were monitored and compared \nwith traditional cultivars. A statistical analysis of the method shows a\nsignificant (p <0.001) determination coefficient R (2)= 0.93 and root-mean-square\nerror of 3.0%.\nCONCLUSIONS: The presented approach allows for non-invasive, fast and objective\nassessment of plant growth. The main contributions of this study are 1) the\nrobust segmentation of RGB images taken from a standard consumer camera directly \nin the field, 2) in particular, the robust background subtraction via\nreconstruction of dense depth maps, and 3) phenotypic applications to monitoring \nof plant growth and computation of fruit-to-leaf ratios in 3D.

These regulatory elements generally function by forming a\nligand-induced alternative fold that controls access to ribosome binding sites or\nother regulatory sites in RNA. Riboswitch-mediated mechanisms are ubiquitous\nacross bacterial genomes. A typical class of riboswitch has its own unique\nstructural and biological complexity, making de novo riboswitch identification a \nformidable task. Traditionally, riboswitches have been identified through\ncomparative genomics based on sequence and structural homology. The limitations\nof structural-homology-based approaches, coupled with the assumption that there\nis a great diversity of undiscovered riboswitches, suggests the need for\nalternative methods for riboswitch identification, possibly based on features\nintrinsic to their structure. As of yet, no such reliable method has been\nproposed.\nRESULTS: We used structural entropy of riboswitch sequences as a measure of their\nsecondary structural dynamics. Entropy values of a diverse set of riboswitches\nwere compared to that of their mutants, their dinucleotide shuffles, and their\nreverse complement sequences under different stochastic context-free grammar\nfolding models. Significance of our results was evaluated by comparison to other \napproaches, such as the base-pairing entropy and energy landscapes dynamics.\nClassifiers based on structural entropy optimized via sequence and structural\nfeatures were devised as riboswitch identifiers and tested on Bacillus subtilis, \nEscherichia coli, and Synechococcus elongatus as an exploration of structural\nentropy based approaches. The unusually long untranslated region of the cotH in\nBacillus subtilis, as well as upstream regions of certain genes, such as the sucC\ngenes were associated with significant structural entropy values in genome-wide\nexaminations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Various tests show that there is in fact a relationship between\nhigher structural entropy and the potential for the RNA sequence to have\nalternative structures, within the limitations of our methodology. This\nrelationship, though modest, is consistent across various tests. Understanding\nthe behavior of structural entropy as a fairly new feature for RNA conformational\ndynamics, however, may require extensive exploratory investigation both across\nRNA sequences and folding models.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0523-2 \nPMCID: PMC4448311\nPMID: 25928324  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

(2)Faculty of Science, Engineering and\nComputing, Kingston University, London, KT1 2EE, UK. j.nebel@kingston.ac.uk.\n\nBACKGROUND: Since experimental techniques are time and cost consuming, in silico \nprotein structure prediction is essential to produce conformations of protein\ntargets. When homologous structures are not available, fragment-based protein\nstructure prediction has become the approach of choice. However, it still has\nmany issues including poor performance when targets' lengths are above 100\nresidues, excessive running times and sub-optimal energy functions. Taking\nadvantage of the reliable performance of structural class prediction software, we\npropose to address some of the limitations of fragment-based methods by\nintegrating structural constraints in their fragment selection process.\nRESULTS: Using Rosetta, a state-of-the-art fragment-based protein structure\nprediction package, we evaluated our proposed pipeline on 70 former CASP targets \ncontaining up to 150 amino acids. Using either CATH or SCOP-based structural\nclass annotations, enhancement of structure prediction performance is highly\nsignificant in terms of both GDT_TS (at least +2.6, p-values < 0.0005) and RMSD\n(-0.4, p-values < 0.005). Although CATH and SCOP classifications are different,\nthey perform similarly. Moreover, proteins from all structural classes benefit\nfrom the proposed methodology. Further analysis also shows that methods relying\non class-based fragments produce conformations which are more relevant to user\nand converge quicker towards the best model as estimated by GDT_TS (up to 10% in \naverage). This substantiates our hypothesis that usage of structurally relevant\ntemplates conducts to not only reducing the size of the conformation space to be \nexplored, but also focusing on a more relevant area.\nCONCLUSIONS: Since our methodology produces models the quality of which is up to \n7% higher in average than those generated by a standard fragment-based predictor,\nwe believe it should be considered before conducting any fragment-based protein\nstructure prediction. Despite such progress, ab initio prediction remains a\nchallenging task, especially for proteins of average and large sizes. Apart from \nimproving search strategies and energy functions, integration of additional\nconstraints seems a promising route, especially if they can be accurately\npredicted from sequence alone.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0576-2 \nPMCID: PMC4419399\nPMID: 25925397  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epub\n2015 Apr 17.\n\nProbabilistic topic modeling for the analysis and classification of genomic\nsequences.\n\nLa Rosa M, Fiannaca A, Rizzo R, Urso A.\n\nBACKGROUND: Studies on genomic sequences for classification and taxonomic\nidentification have a leading role in the biomedical field and in the analysis of\nbiodiversity. These studies are focusing on the so-called barcode genes,\nrepresenting a well defined region of the whole genome. Recently, alignment-free \ntechniques are gaining more importance because they are able to overcome the\ndrawbacks of sequence alignment techniques. In this paper a new alignment-free\nmethod for DNA sequences clustering and classification is proposed. The method is\nbased on k-mers representation and text mining techniques.\nMETHODS: The presented method is based on Probabilistic Topic Modeling, a\nstatistical technique originally proposed for text documents. Probabilistic topic\nmodels are able to find in a document corpus the topics (recurrent themes)\ncharacterizing classes of documents. This technique, applied on DNA sequences\nrepresenting the documents, exploits the frequency of fixed-length k-mers and\nbuilds a generative model for a training group of sequences. This generative\nmodel, obtained through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, is then \nused to classify a large set of genomic sequences.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We performed classification of over 7000 16S DNA barcode\nsequences taken from Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) repository, training\nprobabilistic topic models. The proposed method is compared to the RDP tool and\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm in a extensive set of\ntrials using both complete sequences and short sequence snippets (from 400 bp to \n25 bp). Our method reaches very similar results to RDP classifier and SVM for\ncomplete sequences. The most interesting results are obtained when short sequence\nsnippets are considered. In these conditions the proposed method outperforms RDP \nand SVM with ultra short sequences and it exhibits a smooth decrease of\nperformance, at every taxonomic level, when the sequence length is decreased.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S6-S2 \nPMCID: PMC4416183\nPMID: 25916734  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Such trees\nare believed to be constructed on the basis of certain rules. We have previously \ndeveloped grammar-based compression methods for ordered and unordered single\ntrees, based on bisection-type tree grammars. Here, these methods find\nconstruction rules for one single tree. On the other hand, specified construction\nrules can be utilized to generate multiple similar trees.\nRESULTS: Therefore, in this paper, we develop novel methods to discover common\nrules for the construction of multiple distinct trees, by improving and extending\nthe previous methods using integer programming. We apply our proposed methods to \nseveral sets of glycans and RNA secondary structures, which play important roles \nin cellular systems, and can be regarded as tree structures. The results suggest \nthat our method can be successfully applied to determining the minimum grammar\nand several common rules among glycans and RNAs.\nCONCLUSIONS: We propose integer programming-based methods MinSEOTGMul and\nMinSEUTGMul for the determination of the minimum grammars constructing multiple\nordered and unordered trees, respectively. The proposed methods can provide clues\nfor the determination of hierarchical structures contained in tree-structured\nbiological data, beyond the extraction of frequent patterns.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0558-4 \nPMCID: PMC4419412\nPMID: 25907438  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

To surmount these limitations, we introduce a two-step assessment\ncriterion using: (1) the relative number of total spectra (R TS ) to determine if\ntwo LC-MS/MS datasets are comparable and (2) nine glycolytic enzymes as internal \nstandards for a more accurate calculation of relative amount of proteins.\nLactococcus lactis HR279 and JHK24 strains expressing high or low levels\n(respectively) of green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used for the model system.\nGFP abundance was determined by spectral counting and direct fluorescence\nmeasurements. Statistical analysis determined relative GFP quantity obtained from\nour approach matched values obtained from fluorescence measurements.\nRESULTS: L. lactis HR279 and JHK24 demonstrates two datasets with an R TS value\nless than 1.4 accurately reflects relative differences in GFP levels between high\nand low expression strains. Without prior consideration of R TS and the use of\ninternal standards, the relative increase in GFP calculated by spectral counting \nmethod was 3.92 ± 1.14 fold, which is not correlated with the value determined by\nthe direct fluorescence measurement (2.86 ± 0.42 fold) with the p = 0.024. In\ncontrast, 2.88 ± 0.92 fold was obtained by our approach showing a statistically\ninsignificant difference (p = 0.95).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our two-step assessment demonstrates a useful approach to: (1)\nvalidate the comparability of two mass spectrometric datasets and (2) accurately \ncalculate the relative amount of proteins between proteomic datasets.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0561-9 \nPMCID: PMC4704264\nPMID: 25888384  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the reproducibility \nof identified biomarkers across tissues and experiments is still a challenge for \nthis issue.\nRESULTS: We propose a strategy based on discriminative area of module activities \nto identify gene biomarkers which interconnect as a subnetwork or module by\nintegrating gene expression data and protein-protein interactions. Then, we\nimplement the procedure in T2DM as a case study and identify a module biomarker\nwith 32 genes from mRNA expression data in skeletal muscle for T2DM. This module \nbiomarker is enriched with known causal genes and related functions of T2DM.\nFurther analysis shows that the module biomarker is of superior performance in\nclassification, and has consistently high accuracies across tissues and\nexperiments.\nCONCLUSION: The proposed approach can efficiently identify robust and\nfunctionally meaningful module biomarkers in T2DM, and could be employed in\nbiomarker discovery of other complex diseases characterized by expression\nprofiles.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0519-y \nPMCID: PMC4374500\nPMID: 25888350  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The \nstandard method of measuring this bias in a genetic association study is to\ncompare the observed median association test statistic to the expected median\ntest statistic. This ratio is inflated in the presence of cryptic population\nstructure. However, inflation may also be caused by the properties of the\nassociation test itself particularly in the analysis of rare variants. We\ncompared the properties of the three most commonly used association tests: the\nlikelihood ratio test, the Wald test and the score test when testing rare\nvariants for association using simulated data.\nRESULTS: We found evidence of inflation in the median test statistics of the\nlikelihood ratio and score tests for tests of variants with less than 20\nheterozygotes across the sample, regardless of the total sample size. The test\nstatistics for the Wald test were under-inflated at the median for variants below\nthe same minor allele frequency.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a genetic association study, if a substantial proportion of the\ngenetic variants tested have rare minor allele frequencies, the properties of the\nassociation test may mask the presence or absence of bias due to population\nstructure. The use of either the likelihood ratio test or the score test is\nlikely to lead to inflation in the median test statistic in the absence of\npopulation structure. In contrast, the use of the Wald test is likely to result\nin under-inflation of the median test statistic which may mask the presence of\npopulation structure.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0496-1 \nPMCID: PMC4339749\nPMID: 25888290  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, technology associated errors may\nimpede a powerful assessment of low-frequency mutations. Fortunately, base calls \nare complemented with quality scores which are derived from a quadruplet of\nintensities, one channel for each nucleotide type for Illumina sequencing. The\nhighest intensity of the four channels determines the base that is called.\nMismatch bases can often be corrected by the second best base, i.e. the base with\nthe second highest intensity in the quadruplet. A virus variant model-based\nclustering method, ViVaMBC, is presented that explores quality scores and second \nbest base calls for identifying and quantifying viral variants. ViVaMBC is\noptimized to call variants at the codon level (nucleotide triplets) which enables\nimmediate biological interpretation of the variants with respect to their\nantiviral drug responses.\nRESULTS: Using mixtures of HCV plasmids we show that our method accurately\nestimates frequencies down to 0.5%. The estimates are unbiased when average\ncoverages of 25,000 are reached. A comparison with the SNP-callers V-Phaser2,\nShoRAH, and LoFreq shows that ViVaMBC has a superb sensitivity and specificity\nfor variants with frequencies above 0.4%. Unlike the competitors, ViVaMBC reports\na higher number of false-positive findings with frequencies below 0.4% which\nmight partially originate from picking up artificial variants introduced by\nerrors in the sample and library preparation step.\nCONCLUSIONS: ViVaMBC is the first method to call viral variants directly at the\ncodon level. The strength of the approach lies in modeling the error\nprobabilities based on the quality scores. Although the use of second best base\ncalls appeared very promising in our data exploration phase, their utility was\nlimited. They provided a slight increase in sensitivity, which however does not\nwarrant the additional computational cost of running the offline base caller.\nApparently a lot of information is already contained in the quality scores\nenabling the model based clustering procedure to adjust the majority of the\nsequencing errors. Overall the sensitivity of ViVaMBC is such that technical\nconstraints like PCR errors start to form the bottleneck for low frequency\nvariant detection.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0458-7 \nPMCID: PMC4369097\nPMID: 25887734  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Recently, a growing body of evidence\nsupports that miRNAs are largely dysregulated in obesity and that specific miRNAs\nregulate obesity-associated inflammation. We applied an approach aiming to\nidentify active miRNA-TF-gene regulatory pathways in obesity. Firstly, we\ndetected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed\nmiRNAs (DEmiRs) from mRNA and miRNA expression profiles, respectively. Secondly, \nby mapping the DEGs and DEmiRs to the curated miRNA-TF-gene regulatory network as\nactive seed nodes and connect them with their immediate neighbors, we obtained\nthe potential active miRNA-TF-gene regulatory subnetwork in obesity. Thirdly,\nusing a Breadth-First-Search (BFS) algorithm, we identified potential active\nmiRNA-TF-gene regulatory pathways in obesity. Finally, through the hypergeometric\ntest, we identified the active miRNA-TF-gene regulatory pathways that were\nsignificantly related to obesity.\nRESULTS: The potential active pathways with FDR < 0.0005 were considered to be\nthe active miRNA-TF regulatory pathways in obesity. The union of the active\npathways is visualized and identical nodes of the active pathways were merged.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified 23 active miRNA-TF-gene regulatory pathways that were \nsignificantly related to obesity-related inflammation.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0512-5 \nPMCID: PMC4355475\nPMID: 25887648  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Such discoveries\nprovide novel clues on how the molecular mechanisms involved in the cell cycle\nand cell differentiation processes are coordinated during vulval development.\nDynamic computational models are helpful to understand the integrated regulatory \nmechanisms affecting these cellular processes.\nRESULTS: Here we propose a simplified model of the regulatory network that\nincludes sufficient molecules involved in the control of both the cell cycle and \ncell differentiation in the C. elegans vulva to recover their dynamic behavior.\nWe first infer both the topology and the update rules of the cell cycle module\nfrom an expected time series. Next, we use a symbolic algorithmic approach to\nfind which interactions must be included in the regulatory network. Finally, we\nuse a continuous-time version of the update rules for the cell cycle module to\nvalidate the cyclic behavior of the network, as well as to rule out the presence \nof potential artifacts due to the synchronous updating of the discrete model. We \nanalyze the dynamical behavior of the model for the wild type and several\nmutants, finding that most of the results are consistent with published\nexperimental results.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our model shows that the regulation of Notch signaling by the cell\ncycle preserves the potential of the VPCs and the three vulval fates to\ndifferentiate and de-differentiate, allowing them to remain completely responsive\nto the concentration of LIN-3 and lateral signal in the extracellular\nmicroenvironment.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0498-z \nPMCID: PMC4367908\nPMID: 25884811  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

With high coverage and large sample size, these\nstudies tend to apply simple variant calling algorithms. However, coverage is\noften heterogeneous; sites with insufficient coverage may benefit from\nsophisticated calling algorithms used in low-coverage sequencing studies. We\nevaluate the potential benefits of different calling strategies by performing a\ncomparative analysis of variant calling methods on exonic data from 202 genes\nsequenced at 24x in 7,842 individuals. We call variants using individual-based,\npopulation-based and linkage disequilibrium (LD)-aware methods with stringent\nquality control. We measure genotype accuracy by the concordance with on-target\nGWAS genotypes and between 80 pairs of sequencing replicates. We validate\nselected singleton variants using capillary sequencing.\nRESULTS: Using these calling methods, we detected over 27,500 variants at the\ntargeted exons; >57% were singletons. The singletons identified by\nindividual-based analyses were of the highest quality. However, individual-based \nanalyses generated more missing genotypes (4.72%) than population-based (0.47%)\nand LD-aware (0.17%) analyses. Moreover, individual-based genotypes were the\nleast concordant with array-based genotypes and replicates. Population-based\ngenotypes were less concordant than genotypes from LD-aware analyses with\nextended haplotypes. We reanalyzed the same dataset with a second set of callers \nand showed again that the individual-based caller identified more high-quality\nsingletons than the population-based caller. We also replicated this result in a \nsecond dataset of 57 genes sequenced at 127.5x in 3,124 individuals.\nCONCLUSIONS: We recommend population-based analyses for high quality variant\ncalls with few missing genotypes. With extended haplotypes, LD-aware methods\ngenerate the most accurate and complete genotypes. In addition, individual-based \nanalyses should complement the above methods to obtain the most singleton\nvariants.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0489-0 \nPMCID: PMC4359451\nPMID: 25884587  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Appropriately subtyping\ndepression can lead to identification of subtypes that are more responsive to\ncurrent pharmacological treatment and aid in separating out depressed patients in\nwhich current antidepressants are not particularly effective. Differential\nco-expression analysis (DCEA) and differential regulation analysis (DRA) were\napplied to compare the transcriptomic profiles of peripheral blood lymphocytes\nfrom patients with two depressive subtypes: major depressive disorder (MDD) and\nsubsyndromal symptomatic depression (SSD).\nRESULTS: Six differentially regulated genes (DRGs) (FOSL1, SRF, JUN, TFAP4, SOX9,\nand HLF) and 16 transcription factor-to-target differentially co-expressed gene\nlinks or pairs (TF2target DCLs) appear to be the key differential factors in MDD;\nin contrast, one DRG (PATZ1) and eight TF2target DCLs appear to be the key\ndifferential factors in SSD. There was no overlap between the MDD target genes\nand SSD target genes. Venlafaxine (Efexor™, Effexor™) appears to have a\nsignificant effect on the gene expression profile of MDD patients but no\nsignificant effect on the gene expression profile of SSD patients.\nCONCLUSION: DCEA and DRA revealed no apparent similarities between the\ndifferential regulatory processes underlying MDD and SSD. This bioinformatic\nanalysis may provide novel insights that can support future antidepressant R&D\nefforts.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0543-y \nPMCID: PMC4434877\nPMID: 25880836  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

While essential proteins are enriched in MDSets, we hypothesize that\nthe statistical properties of biological functions of essential genes are\nenhanced when we focus on essential MDSet proteins (e-MDSet).\nRESULTS: Here, we determined minimum dominating sets of proteins (MDSet) in\ninteraction networks of E. coli, S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens, defined as subsets\nof proteins whereby each remaining protein can be reached by a single\ninteraction. We compared several topological and functional parameters of\nessential, MDSet, and essential MDSet (e-MDSet) proteins. In particular, we\nobserved that their topological placement allowed e-MDSet proteins to provide a\npositive correlation between degree and lethality, connect more protein\ncomplexes, and have a stronger impact on network resilience than essential\nproteins alone. In comparison to essential proteins we further found that\ninteractions between e-MDSet proteins appeared more frequently within complexes, \nwhile interactions of e-MDSet proteins between complexes were depleted. Finally, \nthese e-MDSet proteins classified into functional groupings that play a central\nrole in survival and adaptability.\nCONCLUSIONS: The determination of e-MDSet of an organism highlights a set of\nproteins that enhances the enrichment signals of biological functions of\nessential proteins. As a consequence, we surmise that e-MDSets may provide a new \nmethod of evaluating the core proteins of an organism.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0536-x \nPMCID: PMC4411940\nPMID: 25880655  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, fluorescence microscopy images are often noisy, and it can be\ndifficult to distinguish a fluorescently labeled single molecule from background \nspeckle.\nRESULTS: We present a computational pipeline to distinguish the true signal of\nfluorescently labeled molecules from background fluorescence and noise. We test\nour technique using the challenging case of wide-field, epifluorescence\nmicroscope image stacks from single molecule fluorescence in situ experiments on \nnematode embryos where there can be substantial out-of-focus light and structured\nnoise. The software recognizes and classifies individual mRNA spots by measuring \nseveral features of local intensity maxima and classifying them with a supervised\nrandom forest classifier. A key innovation of this software is that, by\nestimating the probability that each local maximum is a true spot in a\nstatistically principled way, it makes it possible to estimate the error\nintroduced by image classification. This can be used to assess the quality of the\ndata and to estimate a confidence interval for the molecule count estimate, all\nof which are important for quantitative interpretations of the results of\nsingle-molecule experiments.\nCONCLUSIONS: The software classifies spots in these images well, with >95% AUROC \non realistic artificial data and outperforms other commonly used techniques on\nchallenging real data. Its interval estimates provide a unique measure of the\nquality of an image and confidence in the classification.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0534-z \nPMCID: PMC4450985\nPMID: 25880543  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Reduced cost and\nhigh throughput sequencing has made large-scale projects achievable to a wider\ngroup of researchers, though complete metagenome sequencing is still a daunting\ntask in terms of sequencing as well as the downstream bioinformatics analyses.\nAlternative approaches such as targeted amplicon sequencing requires custom PCR\nprimer generation, and is not scalable to thousands of genes or gene families.\nRESULTS: In this study, we are presenting a web-based tool called MetCap that\ncircumvents the limitations of amplicon sequencing of multiple genes by designing\nprobes that are suitable for large-scale targeted metagenomics sequencing\nstudies. MetCap provides a novel approach to target thousands of genes and\ngenomic regions that could be used in targeted metagenomics studies. Automatic\nanalysis of user-defined sequences is performed, and probes specifically designed\nfor metagenome studies are generated. To illustrate the advantage of a targeted\nmetagenome approach, we have generated more than 400,000 probes that match more\nthan 300,000 [corrected] publicly available sequences related to carbon\ndegradation, and used these probes for target sequencing in a soil metagenome\nstudy. The results show high enrichment of target genes and a successful\ncapturing of the majority of gene families. MetCap is freely available to users\nfrom: http://soilecology.biol.lu.se/metcap/ .\nCONCLUSION: MetCap is facilitating probe-based target enrichment as an easy and\nefficient alternative tool compared to complex primer-based enrichment for\nlarge-scale investigations of metagenomes. Our results have shown efficient\nlarge-scale target enrichment through MetCap-designed probes for a soil\nmetagenome. The web service is suitable for any targeted metagenomics project\nthat aims to study several genes simultaneously. The novel bioinformatics\napproach taken by the web service will enable researchers in microbial ecology to\ntap into the vast diversity of microbial communities using targeted metagenomics \nas a cost-effective alternative to whole metagenome sequencing.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0501-8 \nPMCID: PMC4355349\nPMID: 25880302  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Roughly speaking, the method first builds a guide\ntree, and then aligns the sequences progressively according to the topology of\nthe tree. It is believed that guide trees are very important to progressive\nalignment; a better guide tree will give an alignment with higher accuracy.\nRecently, we have proposed an adaptive method for constructing guide trees. This \npaper studies the quality of the guide trees constructed by such method. Our\nstudy showed that our adaptive method can be used to improve the accuracy of many\ndifferent progressive MSA tools. In fact, we give evidences showing that the\nguide trees constructed by the adaptive method are among the best.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S5-S4 \nPMCID: PMC4402577\nPMID: 25859903  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In the\nubiquitin-proteasome pathway, E3 ligases play important roles by recognizing a\nspecific protein substrate and catalyzing the attachment of ubiquitin to a lysine\n(K) residue. As more and more experimental data on ubiquitin conjugation sites\nbecome available, it becomes possible to develop prediction models that can be\nscaled to big data. However, no development that focuses on the investigation of \nubiquitinated substrate specificities has existed. Herein, we present an approach\nthat exploits an iteratively statistical method to identify ubiquitin conjugation\nsites with substrate site specificities.\nRESULTS: In this investigation, totally 6259 experimentally validated\nubiquitinated proteins were obtained from dbPTM. After having filtered out\nhomologous fragments with 40% sequence identity, the training data set contained \n2658 ubiquitination sites (positive data) and 5532 non-ubiquitinated sites\n(negative data). Due to the difficulty in characterizing the substrate site\nspecificities of E3 ligases by conventional sequence logo analysis, a recursively\nstatistical method has been applied to obtain significant conserved motifs. The\nprofile hidden Markov model (profile HMM) was adopted to construct the predictive\nmodels learned from the identified substrate motifs. A five-fold cross validation\nwas then used to evaluate the predictive model, achieving sensitivity,\nspecificity, and accuracy of 73.07%, 65.46%, and 67.93%, respectively.\nAdditionally, an independent testing set, completely blind to the training data\nof the predictive model, was used to demonstrate that the proposed method could\nprovide a promising accuracy (76.13%) and outperform other ubiquitination site\nprediction tool.\nCONCLUSION: A case study demonstrated the effectiveness of the characterized\nsubstrate motifs for identifying ubiquitination sites. The proposed method\npresents a practical means of preliminary analysis and greatly diminishes the\ntotal number of potential targets required for further experimental confirmation.\nThis method may help unravel their mechanisms and roles in E3 recognition and\nubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S1-S1 \nPMCID: PMC4331700\nPMID: 25707307  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Whereas the most\ncommon method currently employed is simulated annealing, there have been other\nmethods previously proposed in the literature. Most of them, however, are\ndesigned to find one solution only.\nRESULTS: In order to explore exhaustively the feasible conformational space, we\npropose here an interval Branch-and-Prune algorithm (iBP) to solve the Distance\nGeometry Problem (DGP) associated to protein structure determination. This\nalgorithm is based on a discretization of the problem obtained by recursively\nconstructing a search space having the structure of a tree, and by verifying\nwhether the generated atomic positions are feasible or not by making use of\npruning devices. The pruning devices used here are directly related to features\nof protein conformations.\nCONCLUSIONS: We described the new algorithm iBP to generate protein conformations\nsatisfying distance constraints, that would potentially allows a systematic\nexploration of the conformational space. The algorithm iBP has been applied on\nthree α-helical peptides.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0451-1 \nPMCID: PMC4384350\nPMID: 25627244  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Several data fusion techniques are available to integrate\ngenomics or proteomics data, but only a few studies have created a single\nprediction model using both gene expression and clinical data. These studies\noften remain inconclusive regarding an obtained improvement in prediction\nperformance. To improve clinical management, these data should be fully\nexploited. This requires efficient algorithms to integrate these data sets and\ndesign a final classifier. LS-SVM classifiers and generalized eigenvalue/singular\nvalue decompositions are successfully used in many bioinformatics applications\nfor prediction tasks. While bringing up the benefits of these two techniques, we \npropose a machine learning approach, a weighted LS-SVM classifier to integrate\ntwo data sources: microarray and clinical parameters.\nRESULTS: We compared and evaluated the proposed methods on five breast cancer\ncase studies. Compared to LS-SVM classifier on individual data sets, generalized \neigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) and kernel GEVD, the proposed weighted LS-SVM\nclassifier offers good prediction performance, in terms of test area under ROC\nCurve (AUC), on all breast cancer case studies.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thus a clinical classifier weighted with microarray data set results\nin significantly improved diagnosis, prognosis and prediction responses to\ntherapy.

Three-dimensional microscope images\nare often displayed with volume rendering by adjusting the transfer functions.\nHowever, because the emissions from fluorescent materials and the optical\nproperties based on point spread functions affect the imaging results, the\nintensity value can differ locally, even in the same structure. Further, images\nobtained from brain tissues contain a variety of neural structures such as\ndendrites and axons with complex crossings and overlapping linear structures. In \nthese cases, the transfer functions previously used fail to optimize image\ngeneration, making it difficult to explore the connectivity of these tissues.\nRESULTS: This paper proposes an interactive visual exploration method by which\nthe transfer functions are modified locally and interactively based on\nmultidimensional features in the images. A direct editing interface is also\nprovided to specify both the target region and structures with characteristic\nfeatures, where all manual operations can be performed on the rendered image.\nThis method is demonstrated using two-photon microscope images acquired from\nliving mice, and is shown to be an effective method for interactive visual\nexploration of overlapping similar structures.\nCONCLUSIONS: An interactive visualization method was introduced for local\nimprovement of visualization by volume rendering in two-photon microscope images \ncontaining regions in which linear nerve structures crisscross in a complex\nmanner. The proposed method is characterized by the localized multidimensional\ntransfer function and interface where the parameters can be determined by the\nuser to suit their particular visualization requirements.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0415-x \nPMCID: PMC4279998\nPMID: 25523409  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epub\n2014 Dec 8.\n\nAn integrative model of multi-organ drug-induced toxicity prediction using\ngene-expression data.\n\nKim J, Shin M.\n\nBACKGROUND: In practice, some drugs produce a number of negative biological\neffects that can mitigate their effectiveness as a remedy. To address this issue,\nseveral studies have been performed for the prediction of drug-induced toxicity\nfrom gene-expression data, and a significant amount of work has been done on\npredicting limited drug-induced symptoms or single-organ toxicity. Since drugs\noften lead to some injuries in several organs like liver or kidney, however, it\nwould be very useful to forecast the drug-induced injuries for multiple organs.\nTherefore, in this work, our aim was to develop a multi-organ toxicity prediction\nmodel using an integrative model of gene-expression data.\nRESULTS: To train our integrative model, we used 3708 in-vivo samples of\ngene-expression profiles exposed to one of 41 drugs related to 21 distinct\nphysiological changes divided between liver and kidney (liver 11, kidney 10).\nSpecifically, we used the gene-expression profiles to learn an ensemble\nclassifier for each of 21 pathology prediction models. Subsequently, these\nclassifiers were combined with weights to generate an integrative model for each \npathological finding. The integrative model outputs the likeliness of presenting \nthe trained pathology in a given test sample of gene-expression profile, called\nan integrative prediction score (IPS). For the evaluation of an integrative\nmodel, we estimated the prediction performance with the k-fold cross-validation. \nOur results demonstrate that the proposed integrative model is superior to\nindividual pathology prediction models in predicting multi-organ drug-induced\ntoxicities over all the targeted pathological findings. On average, the AUC of\nthe integrative models was 88% while the AUC of individual pathology prediction\nmodels was 68%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Not only does this integrative model produce comparable prediction\nperformance to existing approaches, but also it produces very stable performance \noverall. In addition, our approach is easily expandable to a variety of other\nmulti-organ toxicology applications.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S2 \nPMCID: PMC4290650\nPMID: 25522097  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Therefore, early, pre-clinical prediction of nephrotoxicity \ncould help to prioritize drug candidates for further evaluations, and increase\nthe success rates of clinical trials. Recently, an in vitro model for predicting \nrenal-proximal-tubular-cell (PTC) toxicity based on the expression levels of two \ninflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6 and -8, has been described. However,\nthis and other existing models usually use linear and manually determined\nthresholds to predict nephrotoxicity. Automated machine learning algorithms may\nimprove these models, and produce more accurate and unbiased predictions.\nRESULTS: Here, we report a systematic comparison of the performances of four\nsupervised classifiers, namely random forest, support vector machine,\nk-nearest-neighbor and naive Bayes classifiers, in predicting PTC toxicity based \non IL-6 and -8 expression levels. Using a dataset of human primary PTCs treated\nwith 41 well-characterized compounds that are toxic or not toxic to PTC, we found\nthat random forest classifiers have the highest cross-validated classification\nperformance (mean balanced accuracy = 87.8%, sensitivity = 89.4%, and specificity\n= 85.9%). Furthermore, we also found that IL-8 is more predictive than IL-6, but \na combination of both markers gives higher classification accuracy. Finally, we\nalso show that random forest classifiers trained automatically on the whole\ndataset have higher mean balanced accuracy than a previous threshold-based\nclassifier constructed for the same dataset (99.3% vs. 80.7%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a random forest classifier can be used to\nautomatically predict drug-induced PTC toxicity based on the expression levels of\nIL-6 and -8.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S16 \nPMCID: PMC4290648\nPMID: 25521947  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

NMR spectroscopy is an excellent technique for\nanalysis of mixtures of organic compounds and gives a detailed chemical\nfingerprint of most individual components above the detection limit. For the\nidentification of individual metabolites in metabolomics, correlation or\ncovariance between peaks in (1)H NMR spectra has previously been successfully\nemployed. Similar correlation of 2D (1)H-(13)C Heteronuclear Single Quantum\nCorrelation spectra was recently applied to investigate the structure of\nheparine. In this paper, we demonstrate how a similar approach can be used to\nidentify metabolites in human biofluids (post-prostatic palpation urine).\nRESULTS: From 50 (1)H-(13)C Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation spectra, 23 \ncorrelation plots resembling pure metabolites were constructed. The identities of\nthese metabolites were confirmed by comparing the correlation plots with reported\nNMR data, mostly from the Human Metabolome Database.\nCONCLUSIONS: Correlation plots prepared by statistically correlating (1)H-(13)C\nHeteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation spectra from human biofluids provide\nunambiguous identification of metabolites. The correlation plots highlight\ncross-peaks belonging to each individual compound, not limited by long-range\nmagnetization transfer as conventional NMR experiments.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0413-z \nPMCID: PMC4274720\nPMID: 25511422  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However,\nontology development and usage can be hampered by the segregation of knowledge by\ndomain that occurs due to independent development and use of the ontologies. The \nability to infer data associated with one ontology to data associated with\nanother ontology would prove useful in expanding information content and scope.\nWe here focus on relating two ontologies: the Gene Ontology (GO), which encodes\ncanonical gene function, and the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP), which\ndescribes non-canonical phenotypes, using statistical methods to suggest GO\nfunctional annotations from existing MP phenotype annotations. This work is in\ncontrast to previous studies that have focused on inferring gene function from\nphenotype primarily through lexical or semantic similarity measures.\nRESULTS: We have designed and tested a set of algorithms that represents a novel \nmethodology to define rules for predicting gene function by examining the\nemergent structure and relationships between the gene functions and phenotypes\nrather than inspecting the terms semantically. The algorithms inspect\nrelationships among multiple phenotype terms to deduce if there are cases where\nthey all arise from a single gene function. We apply this methodology to data\nabout genes in the laboratory mouse that are formally represented in the Mouse\nGenome Informatics (MGI) resource. From the data, 7444 rule instances were\ngenerated from five generalized rules, resulting in 4818 unique GO functional\npredictions for 1796 genes.\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that our method is capable of inferring high-quality\nfunctional annotations from curated phenotype data. As well as creating inferred \nannotations, our method has the potential to allow for the elucidation of\nunforeseen, biologically significant associations between gene function and\nphenotypes that would be overlooked by a semantics-based approach. Future work\nwill include the implementation of the described algorithms for a variety of\nother model organism databases, taking full advantage of the abundance of\navailable high quality curated data.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0405-z \nPMCID: PMC4302099\nPMID: 25495798  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Current\nstate-of-the-art computational approaches for reconstructing gene networks\ndirectly build on such data, making a strong assumption that the system evolves\nin a synchronous fashion at fixed points in time. However, nowadays omics data\nare being generated with increasing time course granularity. Thus, modellers now \nhave the possibility to represent the system as evolving in continuous time and\nto improve the models' expressiveness.\nRESULTS: Continuous time Bayesian networks are proposed as a new approach for\ngene network reconstruction from time course expression data. Their performance\nwas compared to two state-of-the-art methods: dynamic Bayesian networks and\nGranger causality analysis. On simulated data, the methods comparison was carried\nout for networks of increasing size, for measurements taken at different time\ngranularity densities and for measurements unevenly spaced over time. Continuous \ntime Bayesian networks outperformed the other methods in terms of the accuracy of\nregulatory interactions learnt from data for all network sizes. Furthermore,\ntheir performance degraded smoothly as the size of the network increased.\nContinuous time Bayesian networks were significantly better than dynamic Bayesian\nnetworks for all time granularities tested and better than Granger causality for \ndense time series. Both continuous time Bayesian networks and Granger causality\nperformed robustly for unevenly spaced time series, with no significant loss of\nperformance compared to the evenly spaced case, while the same did not hold true \nfor dynamic Bayesian networks. The comparison included the IRMA experimental\ndatasets which confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. Continuous\ntime Bayesian networks were then applied to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms\ncontrolling murine T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation and were found to be\neffective in discovering well-known regulatory mechanisms, as well as new\nplausible biological insights.\nCONCLUSIONS: Continuous time Bayesian networks were effective on networks of both\nsmall and large size and were particularly feasible when the measurements were\nnot evenly distributed over time. Reconstruction of the murine Th17 cell\ndifferentiation network using continuous time Bayesian networks revealed several \nautocrine loops, suggesting that Th17 cells may be auto regulating their own\ndifferentiation process.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0387-x \nPMCID: PMC4267461\nPMID: 25495206  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epub\n2014 Dec 3.\n\nProtein structure prediction with local adjust tabu search algorithm.\n\nLin X, Zhang X, Zhou F.\n\nBACKGROUND: Protein folding structure prediction is one of the most challenging\nproblems in the bioinformatics domain. Because of the complexity of the realistic\nprotein structure, the simplified structure model and the computational method\nshould be adopted in the research. The AB off-lattice model is one of the\nsimplification models, which only considers two classes of amino acids,\nhydrophobic (A) residues and hydrophilic (B) residues.\nRESULTS: The main work of this paper is to discuss how to optimize the lowest\nenergy configurations in 2D off-lattice model and 3D off-lattice model by using\nFibonacci sequences and real protein sequences. In order to avoid falling into\nlocal minimum and faster convergence to the global minimum, we introduce a novel \nmethod (SATS) to the protein structure problem, which combines simulated\nannealing algorithm and tabu search algorithm. Various strategies, such as the\nnew encoding strategy, the adaptive neighborhood generation strategy and the\nlocal adjustment strategy, are adopted successfully for high-speed searching the \noptimal conformation corresponds to the lowest energy of the protein sequences.\nExperimental results show that some of the results obtained by the improved SATS \nare better than those reported in previous literatures, and we can sure that the \nlowest energy folding state for short Fibonacci sequences have been found.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the off-lattice models is not very realistic, they can\nreflect some important characteristics of the realistic protein. It can be found \nthat 3D off-lattice model is more like native folding structure of the realistic \nprotein than 2D off-lattice model. In addition, compared with some previous\nresearches, the proposed hybrid algorithm can more effectively and more quickly\nsearch the spatial folding structure of a protein chain.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-S15-S1 \nPMCID: PMC4271559\nPMID: 25474708  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we engineer non-Mendelian inheritance of the entire maternal or\npaternal genome in Caenorhabditis elegans by changing the structure of the\nmitotic spindle during the first cell division of the zygote. Using\ngermline-specific overexpression of a single protein, the conserved microtubule\nforce regulator GPR-1, we increase forces that pull on spindle poles to convert\nthe single bipolar mitotic spindle to two monopolar spindles. This generates\ntwo-cell embryos in which one cell contains only the maternal chromosomes and the\nother cell contains only the paternal chromosomes. As the embryo develops, each\ncell of the animal, including the germ cells, contains the genetic material of\nonly one parent, resulting in hybrid F1 animals. Progeny of these animals (F2)\ninherit either only F0 maternal or only F0 paternal chromosomes, and thus descend\nfrom only either of their grandparents' gametes.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3643 \nPMID: 27479498  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Here we used a class of\nmodified ASOs that bind to mRNA sequences in upstream open reading frames (uORFs)\nto specifically increase the amounts of protein translated from a downstream\nprimary ORF (pORF). Using ASO treatment, we increased the amount of proteins\nexpressed from four genes by 30-150% in a dose-dependent manner in both human and\nmouse cells. Notably, systemic treatment of mice with ASO resulted in an ∼80%\nprotein increase of LRPPRC. The ASO-mediated increase in protein expression was\nsequence-specific, occurred at the level of translation and was dependent on\nhelicase activity. We also found that the type of RNA modification and the\nposition of modified nucleotides in ASOs affected translation of a pORF. ASOs are\na useful class of therapeutic agents with broad utility.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3589 \nPMID: 27398791  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

With suitable assays and after validation in large cohorts, such\nassociations can be exploited for clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment\ndecisions. Here we describe the results of a community-wide benchmarking study\ncomparing the performance of all widely used methods for DNA methylation analysis\nthat are compatible with routine clinical use. We shipped 32 reference samples to\n18 laboratories in seven different countries. Researchers in those laboratories\ncollectively contributed 21 locus-specific assays for an average of 27 predefined\ngenomic regions, as well as six global assays. We evaluated assay sensitivity on \nlow-input samples and assessed the assays' ability to discriminate between cell\ntypes. Good agreement was observed across all tested methods, with amplicon\nbisulfite sequencing and bisulfite pyrosequencing showing the best all-round\nperformance. Our technology comparison can inform the selection, optimization and\nuse of DNA methylation assays in large-scale validation studies, biomarker\ndevelopment and clinical diagnostics.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3605 \nPMID: 27347756  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Here we harness an\nendogenous signaling pathway to regulate therapeutic gene expression through\ndiet. The GCN2-eIF2α signaling pathway is specifically activated by deficiencies \nin any essential amino acid (EAA); EAA deficiency leads to rapid expression of\ngenes regulated by ATF4-binding cis elements. We found that therapeutic genes\nunder the control of optimized amino acid response elements (AAREs) had low basal\nexpression and high induced expression. We applied our system to regulate the\nexpression of TNFSF10 (TRAIL) in the context of glioma therapy and found that\nintermittent activation of this gene by EEA-deficient meals retained its\ntherapeutic efficacy while abrogating its toxic effects on normal tissue. The\nGCN2-eIF2α pathway is expressed in many tissues, including the brain, and is\nhighly specific to EAA deficiency. Our system may be particularly well suited for\nintermittent regulation of therapeutic transgenes over short or long time\nperiods.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3582 \nPMID: 27272383  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

A major challenge in such approaches is a loss of stem cell potency during \nculture. Here we describe an artificial niche for maintaining muscle stem cells\n(MuSCs) in vitro in a potent, quiescent state. Using a machine learning method,\nwe identified a molecular signature of quiescence and used it to screen for\nfactors that could maintain mouse MuSC quiescence, thus defining a quiescence\nmedium (QM). We also engineered muscle fibers that mimic the native myofiber of\nthe MuSC niche. Mouse MuSCs maintained in QM on engineered fibers showed enhanced\npotential for engraftment, tissue regeneration and self-renewal after\ntransplantation in mice. An artificial niche adapted to human cells similarly\nextended the quiescence of human MuSCs in vitro and enhanced their potency in\nvivo. Our approach for maintaining quiescence may be applicable to stem cells\nisolated from other tissues.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3576 \nPMCID: PMC4942359 [Available on 2016-11-30]\nPMID: 27240197  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

(2)Department of Bioengineering, Rice University, Houston, Texas,\nUSA.\n\nAnabolic metabolism can produce an array of small molecules, but yields and\nproductivities are low owing to carbon and energy inefficiencies and slow\nkinetics. Catabolic and fermentative pathways, on the other hand, are carbon and \nenergy efficient but support only a limited product range. We used carbon- and\nenergy-efficient non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation reactions and\nsubsequent β-reduction reactions, which can accept a variety of functionalized\nprimers and functionalized extender units and operate in an iterative manner, to \nsynthesize functionalized small molecules. Using different ω- and\nω-1-functionalized primers and α-functionalized extender units in combination\nwith various termination pathways, we demonstrate the synthesis of 18 products\nfrom 10 classes, including ω-phenylalkanoic, α,ω-dicarboxylic, ω-hydroxy,\nω-1-oxo, ω-1-methyl, 2-methyl, 2-methyl-2-enolic and 2,3-dihydroxy acids,\nβ-hydroxy-ω-lactones, and ω-1-methyl alcohols.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3505 \nPMID: 27088721  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

CCR9 traffics lymphocytes to intestine and colorectum. We engineered \nuse of the chemokine receptor CCR9 in CRC cell lines and patient-derived cells to\ncreate primary gastrointestinal (GI) tumors in immunodeficient mice by tail-vein \ninjection rather than surgery. The tumors metastasize inducibly and robustly to\nthe liver. Metastases have higher DKK4 and NOTCH signaling levels and are more\nchemoresistant than paired subcutaneous xenografts. Using this approach, we\ngenerated 17 chemokine-targeted mouse models (CTMMs) that recapitulate the\nmajority of common human somatic CRC mutations. We also show that primary tumors \ncan be modeled in immunocompetent mice by microinjecting CCR9-expressing cancer\ncell lines into early-stage mouse blastocysts, which induces central immune\ntolerance. We expect that CTMMs will facilitate investigation of the biology of\nCRC metastasis and drug screening.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3239 \nPMCID: PMC4532544\nPMID: 26006007  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Although many studies have described\ndifferentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to the chondrogenic\nlineage, the generation of chondrocytes able to produce stable articular\ncartilage in vivo has not been demonstrated. Here we show that activation of the \nTGFβ pathway in hPSC-derived chondrogenic progenitors promotes the efficient\ndevelopment of articular chondrocytes that can form stable cartilage tissue in\nvitro and in vivo. In contrast, chondrocytes specified by BMP4 signaling display \ncharacteristics of hypertrophy and give rise to cartilage tissues that initiate\nthe endochondral ossification process in vivo. These findings provide a simple\nserum-free and efficient approach for the routine generation of hPSC-derived\narticular chondrocytes for modeling diseases of the joint and developing cell\ntherapy approaches to treat them.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3210 \nPMID: 25961409  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the hepatic\nvasculature is not an optimal transplant site for several reasons, including\ngraft attrition and the inability to retrieve or image the islets. Here we\ndescribe islet transplantation into a prevascularized, subcutaneous site created \nby temporary placement of a medically approved vascular access catheter. In mice \nwith streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, transplantation of ∼500 syngeneic\nislets into the resulting 'device-less' space reversed diabetes in 91% of mice\nand maintained normoglycemia for >100 days. The approach was also effective in\nmice with pre-existing diabetes, in another mouse strain that mounts a more\nvigorous inflammatory response, and across an allogeneic barrier. These results\ndemonstrate that transient priming of a subcutaneous site supports\ndiabetes-reversing islet transplantation in mouse models without the need for a\npermanent cell-encapsulation device.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3211 \nPMID: 25893782  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we describe a programmable,\nCRISPR-Cas9-based acetyltransferase consisting of the nuclease-null dCas9 protein\nfused to the catalytic core of the human acetyltransferase p300. The fusion\nprotein catalyzes acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 at its target sites,\nleading to robust transcriptional activation of target genes from promoters and\nboth proximal and distal enhancers. Gene activation by the targeted\nacetyltransferase was highly specific across the genome. In contrast to previous \ndCas9-based activators, the acetyltransferase activates genes from enhancer\nregions and with an individual guide RNA. We also show that the core p300 domain \ncan be fused to other programmable DNA-binding proteins. These results support\ntargeted acetylation as a causal mechanism of transactivation and provide a\nrobust tool for manipulating gene regulation.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3199 \nPMCID: PMC4430400\nPMID: 25849900  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We use\ncellular reprogramming and genome engineering to functionally dissect the loss of\nchromosome 7q (del(7q)), a somatic cytogenetic abnormality present in\nmyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We derive del(7q)- and isogenic karyotypically\nnormal induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from hematopoietic cells of MDS\npatients and show that the del(7q) iPSCs recapitulate disease-associated\nphenotypes, including impaired hematopoietic differentiation. These disease\nphenotypes are rescued by spontaneous dosage correction and can be reproduced in \nkaryotypically normal cells by engineering hemizygosity of defined chr7q segments\nin a 20-Mb region. We use a phenotype-rescue screen to identify candidate\nhaploinsufficient genes that might mediate the del(7q)- hematopoietic defect. Our\napproach highlights the utility of human iPSCs both for functional mapping of\ndisease-associated large-scale chromosomal deletions and for discovery of\nhaploinsufficient genes.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3178 \nPMCID: PMC4464949\nPMID: 25798938  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Cell entry of HCV and other pathogens is mediated by tight junction (TJ) \nproteins, but successful therapeutic targeting of TJ proteins has not been\nreported yet. Using a human liver-chimeric mouse model, we show that a monoclonal\nantibody specific for the TJ protein claudin-1 (ref. 7) eliminates chronic HCV\ninfection without detectable toxicity. This antibody inhibits HCV entry,\ncell-cell transmission and virus-induced signaling events. Antibody treatment\nreduces the number of HCV-infected hepatocytes in vivo, highlighting the need for\nde novo infection by means of host entry factors to maintain chronic infection.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that an antibody targeting a virus receptor can cure\nchronic viral infection and uncover TJ proteins as targets for antiviral therapy.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3179 \nPMCID: PMC4430301\nPMID: 25798937  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we\nused quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain acetylation signatures for 19 \ndifferent KDACIs, covering all 18 human lysine deacetylases. Most KDACIs\nincreased acetylation of a small, specific subset of the acetylome, including\nsites on histones and other chromatin-associated proteins. Inhibitor treatment\ncombined with genetic deletion showed that the effects of the pan-sirtuin\ninhibitor nicotinamide are primarily mediated by SIRT1 inhibition. Furthermore,\nwe confirmed that the effects of tubacin and bufexamac on cytoplasmic proteins\nresult from inhibition of HDAC6. Bufexamac also triggered an HDAC6-independent,\nhypoxia-like response by stabilizing HIF1-α, providing a possible mechanistic\nexplanation of its adverse, pro-inflammatory effects. Our results offer a systems\nview of KDACI specificities, providing a framework for studying function of\nacetylation and deacetylases.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3130 \nPMID: 25751058  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we\ndescribe a strategy to address this problem that combines gene expression\nprofiling of large numbers of single cells with data analysis based on diffusion \nmaps for dimensionality reduction and network synthesis from state transition\ngraphs. Applying the approach to hematopoietic development in the mouse embryo,\nwe map the progression of mesoderm toward blood using single-cell gene expression\nanalysis of 3,934 cells with blood-forming potential captured at four time points\nbetween E7.0 and E8.5. Transitions between individual cellular states are then\nused as input to develop a single-cell network synthesis toolkit to generate a\ncomputationally executable transcriptional regulatory network model of blood\ndevelopment. Several model predictions concerning the roles of Sox and Hox\nfactors are validated experimentally. Our results demonstrate that single-cell\nanalysis of a developing organ coupled with computational approaches can reveal\nthe transcriptional programs that underpin organogenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3154 \nPMCID: PMC4374163\nPMID: 25664528  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We detect 230 selective sweeps and\n162 selected copy number variants by analysis of 302 resequenced wild, landrace\nand improved soybean accessions at >11× depth. A genome-wide association study\nusing these new sequences reveals associations between 10 selected regions and 9 \ndomestication or improvement traits, and identifies 13 previously uncharacterized\nloci for agronomic traits including oil content, plant height and pubescence\nform. Combined with previous quantitative trait loci (QTL) information, we find\nthat, of the 230 selected regions, 96 correlate with reported oil QTLs and 21\ncontain fatty acid biosynthesis genes. Moreover, we observe that some traits and \nloci are associated with geographical regions, which shows that soybean\npopulations are structured geographically. This study provides resources for\ngenomics-enabled improvements in soybean breeding.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3096 \nPMID: 25643055  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the effects of potential\nconfounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene\nexpression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations\nremain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent\nvariable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell \nlatent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable\nsubpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the\ndifferentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used \nnot only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different\nsources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3102 \nPMID: 25599176  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Problems arise when\nparts of pathways require specialized environments or compartments for optimal\nfunction. Here we solve this problem through co-culture of engineered organisms, \neach of which contains the part of the pathway that it is best suited to hosting.\nIn one example, we divided the synthetic pathway for the acetylated diol\npaclitaxel precursor into two modules, expressed in either S. cerevisiae or E.\ncoli, neither of which can produce the paclitaxel precursor on their own. Stable \nco-culture in the same bioreactor was achieved by designing a mutualistic\nrelationship between the two species in which a metabolic intermediate produced\nby E. coli was used and functionalized by yeast. This synthetic consortium\nproduced 33 mg/L oxygenated taxanes, including a monoacetylated dioxygenated\ntaxane.

We \nalso identified translocations between bona fide nuclease targets on homologous\nchromosomes, an undesired collateral effect that has not been described\npreviously. Finally, HTGTS confirmed that the Cas9D10A paired nickase approach\nsuppresses off-target cleavage genome-wide.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3101 \nPMCID: PMC4320661\nPMID: 25503383  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

To date there has been no systematic evaluation of the most widely \nused techniques for generating integration-free hiPSCs. Here we compare\nSendai-viral (SeV), episomal (Epi) and mRNA transfection mRNA methods using a\nnumber of criteria. All methods generated high-quality hiPSCs, but significant\ndifferences existed in aneuploidy rates, reprogramming efficiency, reliability\nand workload. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of each approach, and\npresent and review the results of a survey of a large number of human\nreprogramming laboratories on their independent experiences and preferences. Our \nanalysis provides a valuable resource to inform the use of specific reprogramming\nmethods for different laboratories and different applications, including clinical\ntranslation.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3070 \nPMCID: PMC4329913\nPMID: 25437882  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, in\nvivo delivery of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are negatively charged\ndouble-stranded RNA macromolecules, remains a major hurdle. Current siRNA\ndelivery has begun to move away from large lipid and synthetic nanoparticles to\nmore defined molecular conjugates. Here we address this issue by synthesis of\nshort interfering ribonucleic neutrals (siRNNs) whose phosphate backbone contains\nneutral phosphotriester groups, allowing for delivery into cells. Once inside\ncells, siRNNs are converted by cytoplasmic thioesterases into native, charged\nphosphodiester-backbone siRNAs, which induce robust RNAi responses. siRNNs have\nfavorable drug-like properties, including high synthetic yields, serum stability \nand absence of innate immune responses. Unlike siRNAs, siRNNs avidly bind serum\nalbumin to positively influence pharmacokinetic properties. Systemic delivery of \nsiRNNs conjugated to a hepatocyte-specific targeting domain induced extended\ndose-dependent in vivo RNAi responses in mice. We believe that siRNNs represent a\ntechnology that will open new avenues for development of RNAi therapeutics.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3078 \nPMCID: PMC4378643\nPMID: 25402614  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the\nsurvival and function of lineage-reprogrammed cells in vivo over the long term\nhas not been examined. Here, using an improved method for in vivo conversion of\nadult mouse pancreatic acinar cells toward beta cells, we show that induced beta \ncells persist for up to 13 months (the length of the experiment), form pancreatic\nislet-like structures and support normoglycemia in diabetic mice. Detailed\nmolecular analyses of induced beta cells over 7 months reveal that global DNA\nmethylation changes occur within 10 d, whereas the transcriptional network\nevolves over 2 months to resemble that of endogenous beta cells and remains\nstable thereafter. Progressive gain of beta-cell function occurs over 7 months,\nas measured by glucose-regulated insulin release and suppression of\nhyperglycemia. These studies demonstrate that lineage-reprogrammed cells persist \nfor >1 year and undergo epigenetic, transcriptional, anatomical and functional\ndevelopment toward a beta-cell phenotype.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3082 \nPMID: 25402613  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This makes diagnosis and \neffective treatment difficult, so better tools for estimating disease progression\nare needed. Here, we report results from the DREAM-Phil Bowen ALS Prediction\nPrize4Life challenge. In this crowdsourcing competition, competitors developed\nalgorithms for the prediction of disease progression of 1,822 ALS patients from\nstandardized, anonymized phase 2/3 clinical trials. The two best algorithms\noutperformed a method designed by the challenge organizers as well as predictions\nby ALS clinicians. We estimate that using both winning algorithms in future trial\ndesigns could reduce the required number of patients by at least 20%. The\nDREAM-Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life challenge also identified several\npotential nonstandard predictors of disease progression including uric acid,\ncreatinine and surprisingly, blood pressure, shedding light on ALS pathobiology. \nThis analysis reveals the potential of a crowdsourcing competition that uses\nclinical trial data for accelerating ALS research and development.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3051 \nPMID: 25362243  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The clustered, regularly\ninterspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease (Cas)9\nfrom Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) can be used to edit single or multiple genes\nin replicating eukaryotic cells, resulting in frame-shifting insertion/deletion\n(indel) mutations and subsequent protein depletion. Here, we delivered SpCas9 and\nguide RNAs using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to target single (Mecp2) as\nwell as multiple genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) in the adult mouse brain in\nvivo. We characterized the effects of genome modifications in postmitotic neurons\nusing biochemical, genetic, electrophysiological and behavioral readouts. Our\nresults demonstrate that AAV-mediated SpCas9 genome editing can enable reverse\ngenetic studies of gene function in the brain.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3055 \nPMCID: PMC4492112\nPMID: 25326897  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here, we use \nCRISPR-Cas technology to create antimicrobials whose spectrum of activity is\nchosen by design. RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) targeting specific DNA sequences\nare delivered efficiently to microbial populations using bacteriophage or\nbacteria carrying plasmids transmissible by conjugation. The DNA targets of RGNs \ncan be undesirable genes or polymorphisms, including antibiotic resistance and\nvirulence determinants in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and\nenterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Delivery of RGNs significantly improves\nsurvival in a Galleria mellonella infection model. We also show that RGNs enable \nmodulation of complex bacterial populations by selective knockdown of targeted\nstrains based on genetic signatures. RGNs constitute a class of highly\ndiscriminatory, customizable antimicrobials that enact selective pressure at the \nDNA level to reduce the prevalence of undesired genes, minimize off-target\neffects and enable programmable remodeling of microbiota.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3011 \nPMCID: PMC4237163\nPMID: 25240928  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

(5)Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland,\nUSA.\n\nHundreds of genetically characterized cell lines are available for the discovery \nof genotype-specific cancer vulnerabilities. However, screening large numbers of \ncompounds against large numbers of cell lines is currently impractical, and such \nexperiments are often difficult to control. Here we report a method called PRISM \nthat allows pooled screening of mixtures of cancer cell lines by labeling each\ncell line with 24-nucleotide barcodes. PRISM revealed the expected patterns of\ncell killing seen in conventional (unpooled) assays. In a screen of 102 cell\nlines across 8,400 compounds, PRISM led to the identification of BRD-7880 as a\npotent and highly specific inhibitor of aurora kinases B and C. Cell line pools\nalso efficiently formed tumors as xenografts, and PRISM recapitulated the\nexpected pattern of erlotinib sensitivity in vivo.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3460 \nPMID: 26928769  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

To generate an antiviral agent capable of eradicating \nthe provirus from infected cells, we employed 145 cycles of substrate-linked\ndirected evolution to evolve a recombinase (Brec1) that site-specifically\nrecognizes a 34-bp sequence present in the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of the\nmajority of the clinically relevant HIV-1 strains and subtypes. Brec1\nefficiently, precisely and safely removes the integrated provirus from infected\ncells and is efficacious on clinical HIV-1 isolates in vitro and in vivo,\nincluding in mice humanized with patient-derived cells. Our data suggest that\nBrec1 has potential for clinical application as a curative HIV-1 therapy.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3467 \nPMID: 26900663  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However,\nclinical implementation of this technology requires safe and effective delivery\nof all of these components into the nuclei of the target tissue. Here, we combine\nlipid nanoparticle-mediated delivery of Cas9 mRNA with adeno-associated viruses\nencoding a sgRNA and a repair template to induce repair of a disease gene in\nadult animals. We applied our delivery strategy to a mouse model of human\nhereditary tyrosinemia and show that the treatment generated fumarylacetoacetate \nhydrolase (Fah)-positive hepatocytes by correcting the causative Fah-splicing\nmutation. Treatment rescued disease symptoms such as weight loss and liver\ndamage. The efficiency of correction was >6% of hepatocytes after a single\napplication, suggesting potential utility of Cas9-based therapeutic genome\nediting for a range of diseases.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3471 \nPMID: 26829318  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here, we present the multiplexed editing regulatory assay (MERA), a\nhigh-throughput CRISPR-Cas9-based approach that analyzes the functional impact of\nthe regulatory genome in its native context. MERA tiles thousands of mutations\nacross ∼40 kb of cis-regulatory genomic space and uses knock-in green fluorescent\nprotein (GFP) reporters to read out gene activity. Using this approach, we obtain\nquantitative information on the contribution of cis-regulatory regions to gene\nexpression. We identify proximal and distal regulatory elements necessary for\nexpression of four embryonic stem cell-specific genes. We show a consistent\ncontribution of neighboring gene promoters to gene expression and identify\nunmarked regulatory elements (UREs) that control gene expression but do not have \ntypical enhancer epigenetic or chromatin features. We compare thousands of\nfunctional and nonfunctional genotypes at a genomic location and identify the\nbase pair-resolution functional motifs of regulatory elements.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3468 \nPMID: 26807528  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the direct\nrelationship between these parameters and the molecular phenotypes has remained\nlargely unexplored. Here, we present a method for obtaining full transcriptome\ndata from single neocortical pyramidal cells and interneurons after whole-cell\npatch-clamp recordings in mouse brain slices. In our approach, termed Patch-seq, \na patch-clamp stimulus protocol is followed by the aspiration of the entire\nsomatic compartment into the recording pipette, reverse transcription of RNA\nincluding addition of unique molecular identifiers, cDNA amplification, Illumina \nlibrary preparation and sequencing. We show that Patch-seq reveals a close link\nbetween electrophysiological characteristics, responses to acute chemical\nchallenges and RNA expression of neurotransmitter receptors and channels.\nMoreover, it distinguishes neuronal subpopulations that correspond to both\nwell-established and, to our knowledge, hitherto undescribed neuronal subtypes.\nOur findings demonstrate the ability of Patch-seq to precisely map neuronal\nsubtypes and predict their network contributions in the brain.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3443 \nPMCID: PMC4745137\nPMID: 26689544  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We\ndescribe CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease constructs that function as gene drive systems \nin Anopheles gambiae, the main vector for malaria. We identified three genes\n(AGAP005958, AGAP011377 and AGAP007280) that confer a recessive female-sterility \nphenotype upon disruption, and inserted into each locus CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive\nconstructs designed to target and edit each gene. For each targeted locus we\nobserved a strong gene drive at the molecular level, with transmission rates to\nprogeny of 91.4 to 99.6%. Population modeling and cage experiments indicate that \na CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting one of these loci, AGAP007280, meets the\nminimum requirement for a gene drive targeting female reproduction in an insect\npopulation. These findings could expedite the development of gene drives to\nsuppress mosquito populations to levels that do not support malaria transmission.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3439 \nPMCID: PMC4913862\nPMID: 26641531  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Implementation\ntypically requires remote light sources and fiber-optic delivery schemes that\nimpose considerable physical constraints on natural behaviors. In this report we \nbypass these limitations using technologies that combine thin, mechanically soft \nneural interfaces with fully implantable, stretchable wireless radio power and\ncontrol systems. The resulting devices achieve optogenetic modulation of the\nspinal cord and peripheral nervous system. This is demonstrated with two form\nfactors; stretchable film appliqués that interface directly with peripheral\nnerves, and flexible filaments that insert into the narrow confines of the spinal\nepidural space. These soft, thin devices are minimally invasive, and histological\ntests suggest they can be used in chronic studies. We demonstrate the power of\nthis technology by modulating peripheral and spinal pain circuitry, providing\nevidence for the potential widespread use of these devices in research and future\nclinical applications of optogenetics outside the brain.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3415 \nPMCID: PMC4880021\nPMID: 26551059  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]\n\n",

Here, we attached small \nmolecule TLR-7/8a to polymer scaffolds (polymer-TLR-7/8a) and evaluated how\ndifferent physicochemical properties of the TLR-7/8a and polymer carrier\ninfluenced the location, magnitude and duration of innate immune activation in\nvivo. Particle formation by polymer-TLR-7/8a was the most important factor for\nrestricting adjuvant distribution and prolonging activity in draining lymph\nnodes. The improved pharmacokinetic profile by particulate polymer-TLR-7/8a was\nalso associated with reduced morbidity and enhanced vaccine immunogenicity for\ninducing antibodies and T cell immunity. We extended these findings to the\ndevelopment of a modular approach in which protein antigens are site-specifically\nlinked to temperature-responsive polymer-TLR-7/8a adjuvants that self-assemble\ninto immunogenic particles at physiologic temperatures in vivo. Our findings\nprovide a chemical and structural basis for optimizing adjuvant design to elicit \nbroad-based antibody and T cell responses with protein antigens.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3371 \nPMID: 26501954  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Nat Biotechnol. 2015 Nov;33(11):1152-8.\n\nComprehensive analysis of cancer-associated somatic mutations in class I HLA\ngenes.\n\nShukla SA, Rooney MS, Rajasagi M, Tiao G, Dixon PM, Lawrence MS, Stevens J, Lane \nWJ, Dellagatta JL, Steelman S, Sougnez C, Cibulskis K, Kiezun A, Hacohen N,\nBrusic V, Wu CJ, Getz G.\n\nDetection of somatic mutations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes using\nwhole-exome sequencing (WES) is hampered by the high polymorphism of the HLA\nloci, which prevents alignment of sequencing reads to the human reference genome.\nWe describe a computational pipeline that enables accurate inference of germline \nalleles of class I HLA-A, B and C genes and subsequent detection of mutations in \nthese genes using the inferred alleles as a reference. Analysis of WES data from \n7,930 pairs of tumor and healthy tissue from the same patient revealed 298\nnonsilent HLA mutations in tumors from 266 patients. These 298 mutations are\nenriched for likely functional mutations, including putative loss-of-function\nevents. Recurrence of mutations suggested that these 'hotspot' sites were\npositively selected. Cancers with recurrent somatic HLA mutations were associated\nwith upregulation of signatures of cytolytic activity characteristic of tumor\ninfiltration by effector lymphocytes, supporting immune evasion by altered HLA\nfunction as a contributory mechanism in cancer.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3344 \nPMCID: PMC4747795\nPMID: 26372948  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

With the\naim of improving endosomal release, a poorly understood and inefficient process, \nwe studied the uptake and cytosolic release of siRNAs, formulated in lipoplexes\nor lipid nanoparticles, by live-cell imaging and correlated it with knockdown of \na target GFP reporter. siRNA release occurred invariably from maturing endosomes \nwithin ~5-15 min of endocytosis. Cytosolic galectins immediately recognized the\ndamaged endosome and targeted it for autophagy. However, inhibiting autophagy did\nnot enhance cytosolic siRNA release. Gene knockdown occurred within a few hours\nof release and required <2,000 copies of cytosolic siRNAs. The ability to detect \ncytosolic release of siRNAs and understand how it is regulated will facilitate\nthe development of rational strategies for improving the cytosolic delivery of\ncandidate drugs.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3298 \nPMCID: PMC4663660\nPMID: 26192320  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

To enable modeling and drug discovery for biliary disease, we\ndescribe a protocol that achieves efficient differentiation of biliary epithelial\ncells (cholangiocytes) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through delivery\nof developmentally relevant cues, including NOTCH signaling. Using\nthree-dimensional culture, the protocol yields cystic and/or ductal structures\nthat express mature biliary markers, including apical sodium-dependent bile acid \ntransporter, secretin receptor, cilia and cystic fibrosis transmembrane\nconductance regulator (CFTR). We demonstrate that hPSC-derived cholangiocytes\npossess epithelial functions, including rhodamine efflux and CFTR-mediated fluid \nsecretion. Furthermore, we show that functionally impaired hPSC-derived\ncholangiocytes from cystic fibrosis patients are rescued by CFTR correctors.\nThese findings demonstrate that mature cholangiocytes can be differentiated from \nhPSCs and used for studies of biliary development and disease.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3294 \nPMID: 26167630  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we apply optogenetics, widely used to\nmodulate neuronal excitability, for cardiac pacing and resynchronization. We used\nadeno-associated virus (AAV) 9 to express the Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) transgene\nat one or more ventricular sites in rats. This allowed optogenetic pacing of the \nhearts at different beating frequencies with blue-light illumination both in vivo\nand in isolated perfused hearts. Optical mapping confirmed that the source of the\nnew pacemaker activity was the site of ChR2 transgene delivery. Notably, diffuse \nillumination of hearts where the ChR2 transgene was delivered to several\nventricular sites resulted in electrical synchronization and significant\nshortening of ventricular activation times. These findings highlight the unique\npotential of optogenetics for cardiac pacing and resynchronization therapies.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3268 \nPMID: 26098449  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This gene-set modelling framework was later applied to find\nassociations between mRNA expression and microRNA expression, by defining the\ngene sets using target prediction information.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we extend the model introduced by Menezes et al. 2009 \nto consider the effect of not just copy number, but also of other molecular\nprofiles such as methylation changes and loss-of-heterozigosity (LOH), on gene\nexpression levels. We will consider again sets of measurements, to improve\nrobustness of results and increase the power to find associations. Our approach\ncan be used genome-wide to find associations and yields a test to help separate\ntrue associations from noise. We apply our method to colon and to breast cancer\nsamples, for which genome-wide copy number, methylation and gene expression\nprofiles are available. Our findings include interesting gene\nexpression-regulating mechanisms, which may involve only one of copy number or\nmethylation, or both for the same samples. We even are able to find effects due\nto different molecular mechanisms in different samples.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our method can equally well be applied to cases where other types of\nmolecular (high-dimensional) data are collected, such as LOH, SNP genotype and\nmicroRNA expression data. Computationally efficient, it represents a flexible and\npowerful tool to study associations between high-dimensional datasets.

However, wide spread use is limited since an advanced knowledge of\nstatistics and statistical software is required.\nRESULTS: In order to improve accessibility we created Web-TCGA, a web based,\nfreely accessible online tool, which can also be run in a private instance, for\nintegrated analysis of molecular cancer data sets provided by TCGA. In contrast\nto already available tools, Web-TCGA utilizes different methods for analysis and \nvisualization of TCGA data, allowing users to generate global molecular profiles \nacross different cancer entities simultaneously. In addition to global molecular \nprofiles, Web-TCGA offers highly detailed gene and tumor entity centric analysis \nby providing interactive tables and views.\nCONCLUSIONS: As a supplement to other already available tools, such as cBioPortal\n(Sci Signal 6:pl1, 2013, Cancer Discov 2:401-4, 2012), Web-TCGA is offering an\nanalysis service, which does not require any installation or configuration, for\nmolecular data sets available at the TCGA. Individual processing requests\n(queries) are generated by the user for mutation, methylation, expression and\ncopy number variation (CNV) analyses. The user can focus analyses on results from\nsingle genes and cancer entities or perform a global analysis (multiple cancer\nentities and genes simultaneously).\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0917-9 \nPMCID: PMC4744375\nPMID: 26852330  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In some instances, it is crucial to assess in\nsilico the options as well as the impact of various crossing schemes and breeding\napproaches on performance for traits of interest such as grain yield. For this, a\nmeans by which gene effects can be represented in the genome model is critical.\nRESULTS: To address this need, we devised a method to represent the genomic\ndistribution of additive and dominance gene effects associated with quantitative \ntraits. The method, based on meta-analysis of previously-estimated QTL effects\nfollowing Bennewitz and Meuwissen (J Anim Breed Genet 127:171-9, 2010), utilizes \na modified Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM) to fit the number of \nmixture components and estimate parameters (i.e. mean and variance) of the\ngenomic distribution. The method was demonstrated using several maize QTL data\nsets to provide estimates of additive and dominance effects for grain yield and\nother quantitative traits for application in maize genome simulations.\nCONCLUSIONS: The DPGMM method offers an alternative to the over-simplified\ninfinitesimal model in computer simulation as a means to better represent the\ngenetic architecture of quantitative traits, which likely involve some large\neffects in addition to many small effects. Furthermore, it confers an advantage\nover other methods in that the number of mixture model components need not be\nknown a priori. In addition, the method is robust with use of large-scale,\nmulti-allelic data sets or with meta-analyses of smaller QTL data sets which may \nbe derived from bi-parental populations in precisely estimating distribution\nparameters. Thus, the method has high utility in representing the genetic\narchitecture of quantitative traits in computer simulation.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0906-z \nPMCID: PMC4744427\nPMID: 26852240  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Generally, the workflow includes\nquality control of reads, mapping to a reference, counting transcript abundance, \nand statistical tests for differentially expressed genes. In spite of the\nnumerous tools developed for each component of an RNA-seq analysis workflow,\neasy-to-use bacterially oriented workflow applications to combine multiple tools \nand automate the process are lacking. With many tools to choose from for each\nstep, the task of identifying a specific tool, adapting the input/output options \nto the specific use-case, and integrating the tools into a coherent analysis\npipeline is not a trivial endeavor, particularly for microbiologists with limited\nbioinformatics experience.\nRESULTS: To make bacterial RNA-seq data analysis more accessible, we developed a \nSimple Program for Automated reference-based bacterial RNA-seq Transcriptome\nAnalysis (SPARTA). SPARTA is a reference-based bacterial RNA-seq analysis\nworkflow application for single-end Illumina reads. SPARTA is turnkey software\nthat simplifies the process of analyzing RNA-seq data sets, making bacterial\nRNA-seq analysis a routine process that can be undertaken on a personal computer \nor in the classroom. The easy-to-install, complete workflow processes whole\ntranscriptome shotgun sequencing data files by trimming reads and removing\nadapters, mapping reads to a reference, counting gene features, calculating\ndifferential gene expression, and, importantly, checking for potential batch\neffects within the data set. SPARTA outputs quality analysis reports, gene\nfeature counts and differential gene expression tables and scatterplots.\nCONCLUSIONS: SPARTA provides an easy-to-use bacterial RNA-seq transcriptional\nprofiling workflow to identify differentially expressed genes between\nexperimental conditions. This software will enable microbiologists with limited\nbioinformatics experience to analyze their data and integrate next generation\nsequencing (NGS) technologies into the classroom.

Yet, the topological and functional\ncharacterization of real GRNs is often still partial and an exhaustive picture of\ntheir functioning is missing.\nRESULTS: We here introduce CABERNET, a Cytoscape app for the generation,\nsimulation and analysis of Boolean models of GRNs, specifically focused on their \naugmentation when a only partial topological and functional characterization of\nthe network is available. By generating large ensembles of networks in which\nuser-defined entities and relations are added to the original core, CABERNET\nallows to formulate hypotheses on the missing portions of real networks, as well \nto investigate their generic properties, in the spirit of complexity science.\nCONCLUSIONS: CABERNET offers a series of innovative simulation and modeling\nfunctions and tools, including (but not being limited to) the dynamical\ncharacterization of the gene activation patterns ruling cell types and\ndifferentiation fates, and sophisticated robustness assessments, as in the case\nof gene knockouts. The integration within the widely used Cytoscape framework for\nthe visualization and analysis of biological networks, makes CABERNET a new\nessential instrument for both the bioinformatician and the computational\nbiologist, as well as a computational support for the experimentalist.

Characterising protein conformational dynamics is increasingly\nrecognised as necessary to understand how proteins function. Given a\nconformational ensemble, computational tools are needed to extract in a\nsystematic way pertinent and comprehensive biological information.\nRESULTS: Here, we present a method, Communication Mapping (COMMA), to decipher\nthe dynamical architecture of a protein. The method first extracts residue-based \ndynamic properties from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Then, it\nintegrates them in a graph theoretic framework, where it identifies groups of\nresidues or protein regions that mediate short- and long-range communication.\nCOMMA introduces original concepts to contrast the different roles played by\nthese regions, namely communication blocks and communicating segment pairs, and\nevaluates the connections and communication strengths between them. We show the\nutility and capabilities of COMMA by applying it to three archetypal proteins,\nnamely protein A, the tyrosine kinase KIT and the tumour suppressor p53.\nCONCLUSION: Our method permits to compare in a direct way the dynamical behaviour\neither of proteins with different characteristics or of the same protein in\ndifferent conditions. It is useful to identify residues playing a key role in\nprotein allosteric regulation and to explain the effects of deleterious mutations\nin a mechanistic way.

New visualization techniques can help researchers\nnavigate and understand these big data. Horizon Charts are a relatively new\nvisualization method that, under the right circumstances, maximizes data density \nwithout losing graphical perception.\nRESULTS: Horizon Charts have been successfully applied to understand multi-metric\ntime series data. We have adapted an existing JavaScript library (Cubism) that\nimplements Horizon Charts for the time series domain so that it works effectively\nwith genomic datasets.

Genome-wide microarray \ndata enable unbiased documentation of alterations in gene expression that may be \ndisease-specific. As genetic diseases are believed to be caused by genetic\nalterations affecting the function of signalling pathways, module-centric\noptimisation algorithms, whose aim is to identify sub-networks that are\ndys-regulated in disease, are emerging as promising approaches.\nRESULTS: In order to account for the topological structure of molecular\ninteraction networks, we developed an optimisation algorithm that integrates\ndatabases of known molecular interactions with gene expression data; such\nintegration enables identification of differentially regulated network modules.\nWe verified the performance of our algorithm by testing it on simulated networks;\nwe then applied the same method to study experimental data derived from\nmicroarray analysis of CD and UC biopsies and human interactome databases. This\nanalysis allowed the extraction of dys-regulated subnetworks under different\nexperimental conditions (inflamed and uninflamed tissues in CD and UC).\nOptimisation was performed to highlight differentially expressed network modules \nthat may be common or specific to the disease subtype.\nCONCLUSIONS: We show that the selected subnetworks include genes and pathways of \nknown relevance for IBD; in particular, the solutions found highlight cross-talk \namong enriched pathways, mainly the JAK/STAT signalling pathway and the EGF\nreceptor signalling pathway. In addition, integration of gene expression with\nmolecular interaction data highlights nodes that, although not being\ndifferentially expressed, interact with differentially expressed nodes and are\npart of pathways that are relevant to IBD. The method proposed here may help\nidentifying dys-regulated sub-networks that are common in different diseases and \nsub-networks whose dys-regulation is specific to a particular disease.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0886-z \nPMCID: PMC4719745\nPMID: 26787018  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Feature extraction\nfacilitates classification, clustering and model analysis for testing and\nrefining biological hypotheses. \"Shotgun\" metagenome is an analytically\nchallenging type of genomic data - containing sequences of all genes from the\ntotality of a complex microbial community. Recently, researchers started to\nanalyze metagenomes using reference-free methods based on the analysis of\noligonucleotides (k-mers) frequency spectrum previously applied to isolated\ngenomes. However, little is known about their correlation with the existing\napproaches for metagenomic feature extraction, as well as the limits of\napplicability. Here we evaluated a metagenomic pairwise dissimilarity measure\nbased on short k-mer spectrum using the example of human gut microbiota, a\nbiomedically significant object of study.\nRESULTS: We developed a method for calculating pairwise dissimilarity\n(beta-diversity) of \"shotgun\" metagenomes based on short k-mer spectra (5 ≤ k ≤\n11). The method was validated on simulated metagenomes and further applied to a\nlarge collection of human gut metagenomes from the populations of the world\n(n=281). The k-mer spectrum-based measure was found to behave similarly to one\nbased on mapping to a reference gene catalog, but different from one using a\ngenome catalog. This difference turned out to be associated with a significant\npresence of viral reads in a number of metagenomes. Simulations showed limited\nimpact of bacterial genetic variability as well as sequencing errors on k-mer\nspectra. Specific differences between the datasets from individual populations\nwere identified.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our approach allows rapid estimation of pairwise dissimilarity\nbetween metagenomes. Though we applied this technique to gut microbiota, it\nshould be useful for arbitrary metagenomes, even metagenomes with novel\nmicrobiota. Dissimilarity measure based on k-mer spectrum provides a wider\nperspective in comparison with the ones based on the alignment against reference \nsequence sets. It helps not to miss possible outstanding features of metagenomic \ncomposition, particularly related to the presence of an unknown bacteria, virus\nor eukaryote, as well as to technical artifacts (sample contamination, reads of\nnon-biological origin, etc.) at the early stages of bioinformatic analysis. Our\nmethod is complementary to reference-based approaches and can be easily\nintegrated into metagenomic analysis pipelines.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0875-7 \nPMCID: PMC4715287\nPMID: 26774270  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This is perhaps best\nexemplified in the layering, or lamination, of the retinal inner plexiform layer \n(IPL). The neurites of the retinal ganglion, amacrine and bipolar cell subtypes\nthat form synapses in the IPL are precisely organized in highly refined strata\nwithin the IPL. Studies focused on developmental organization and cell morphology\noften use this layered stratification to characterize cells and identify the\nfunction of genes in development of the retina. A current limitation to such\nanalysis is the lack of standardized tools to quantitatively analyze this complex\nstructure. Most previous work on neuron stratification in the IPL is qualitative \nand descriptive.\nRESULTS: In this study we report the development of an intuitive platform to\nrapidly and reproducibly assay IPL lamination. The novel ImageJ based software\nplugin we developed: IPLaminator, rapidly analyzes neurite stratification\npatterns in the retina and other neural tissues. A range of user options allows\nresearchers to bin IPL stratification based on fixed points, such as the neurites\nof cholinergic amacrine cells, or to define a number of bins into which the IPL\nwill be divided. Options to analyze tissues such as cortex were also added.\nStatistical analysis of the output then allows a quantitative value to be\nassigned to differences in laminar patterning observed in different models,\ngenotypes or across developmental time.\nCONCLUSION: IPLaminator is an easy to use software application that will greatly \nspeed and standardize quantification of neuron organization.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0876-1 \nPMCID: PMC4715356\nPMID: 26772546  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The important task of selecting informative variables can\ntherefore become complex. In this paper we look at discriminating between two\ngroups. Two tasks need to be performed: (i) finding variables which differ\nbetween the two groups; and (ii) determining how the selected variables can be\nused to classify new subjects. We introduce an approach using minimum\nclassification error rates as test statistics to find discriminatory and\ntherefore informative variables. The thresholds resulting in the minimum error\nrates can be used to classify new subjects. This approach transforms error rates \ninto p-values and is referred to as ERp.\nRESULTS: We show that non-parametric hypothesis testing, based on minimum\nclassification error rates as test statistics, can find statistically\nsignificantly shifted variables. The discriminatory ability of variables becomes \nmore apparent when error rates are evaluated based on their corresponding\np-values, as relatively high error rates can still be statistically significant. \nERp can handle unequal and small group sizes, as well as account for the cost of \nmisclassification. ERp retains (if known) or reveals (if unknown) the shift\ndirection, aiding in biological interpretation. The threshold resulting in the\nminimum error rate can immediately be used to classify new subjects. We use NMR\ngenerated metabolomics data to illustrate how ERp is able to discriminate\nsubjects diagnosed with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected meningitis from a\ncontrol group. The list of discriminatory variables produced by ERp contains all \nbiologically relevant variables with appropriate shift directions discussed in\nthe original paper from which this data is taken.\nCONCLUSIONS: ERp performs variable selection and classification, is\nnon-parametric and aids biological interpretation while handling unequal group\nsizes and misclassification costs. All this is achieved by a single approach\nwhich is easy to perform and interpret. ERp has the potential to address many\nother characteristics of metabolomics data. Future research aims to extend ERp to\naccount for a large proportion of observations below the detection limit, as well\nas expand on interactions between variables.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0867-7 \nPMCID: PMC4712617\nPMID: 26763892  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epub\n2015 Dec 9.\n\nA two-layered machine learning method to identify protein O-GlcNAcylation sites\nwith O-GlcNAc transferase substrate motifs.\n\nKao HJ, Huang CH, Bretaña NA, Lu CT, Huang KY, Weng SL, Lee TY.\n\nProtein O-GlcNAcylation, involving the β-attachment of single N-acetylglucosamine\n(GlcNAc) to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues, is an O-linked\nglycosylation catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Molecular level\ninvestigation of the basis for OGT's substrate specificity should aid\nunderstanding how O-GlcNAc contributes to diverse cellular processes. Due to an\nincreasing number of O-GlcNAcylated peptides with site-specific information\nidentified by mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, we were motivated to\ncharacterize substrate site motifs of O-GlcNAc transferases. In this\ninvestigation, a non-redundant dataset of 410 experimentally verified\nO-GlcNAcylation sites were manually extracted from dbOGAP, OGlycBase and\nUniProtKB. After detection of conserved motifs by using maximal dependence\ndecomposition, profile hidden Markov model (profile HMM) was adopted to learn a\nfirst-layered model for each identified OGT substrate motif. Support Vector\nMachine (SVM) was then used to generate a second-layered model learned from the\noutput values of profile HMMs in first layer. The two-layered predictive model\nwas evaluated using a five-fold cross validation which yielded a sensitivity of\n85.4%, a specificity of 84.1%, and an accuracy of 84.7%. Additionally, an\nindependent testing set from PhosphoSitePlus, which was really non-homologous to \nthe training data of predictive model, was used to demonstrate that the proposed \nmethod could provide a promising accuracy (84.05%) and outperform other\nO-GlcNAcylation site prediction tools.

Epub\n2015 Dec 7.\n\nSpliceJumper: a classification-based approach for calling splicing junctions from\nRNA-seq data.\n\nChu C, Li X, Wu Y.\n\nBACKGROUND: Next-generation RNA sequencing technologies have been widely applied \nin transcriptome profiling. This facilitates further studies of gene structure\nand expression on the genome wide scale. It is an important step to align reads\nto the reference genome and call out splicing junctions for the following\nanalysis, such as the analysis of alternative splicing and isoform construction. \nHowever, because of the existence of introns, when RNA-seq reads are aligned to\nthe reference genome, reads can not be fully mapped at splicing sites. Thus, it\nis challenging to align reads and call out splicing junctions accurately.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we present a classification based approach for calling\nsplicing junctions from RNA-seq data, which is implemented in the program\nSpliceJumper. SpliceJumper uses a machine learning approach which combines\nmultiple features extracted from RNA-seq data. We compare SpliceJumper with two\nexisting RNA-seq analysis approaches, TopHat2 and MapSplice2, on both simulated\nand real data. Our results show that SpliceJumper outperforms TopHat2 and\nMapSplice2 in accuracy.

These correlations can be studied using mutual\ninformation because it measures the amount of information one random variable\ncontains about the other. Here we present MIA (Mutual Information Analyzer) a\nuser friendly graphic interface pipeline that calculates spectra of vertical\nentropy (VH), vertical mutual information (VMI) and horizontal mutual information\n(HMI), since currently there is no user friendly integrated platform that in a\nsingle package perform all these calculations. MIA also calculates Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence (JSD) between pair of different species spectra, herein called\ninformational distances. Thus, the resulting distance matrices can be presented\nby distance histograms and informational dendrograms, giving support to\ndiscrimination of closely related species.\nRESULTS: In order to test MIA we analyzed sequences from Drosophila Adh locus,\nbecause the taxonomy and evolutionary patterns of different Drosophila species\nare well established and the gene Adh is extensively studied. The search\nretrieved 959 sequences of 291 species. From the total, 450 sequences of 17\nspecies were selected. With this dataset MIA performed all tasks in less than\nthree hours: gathering, storing and aligning fasta files; calculating VH, VMI and\nHMI spectra; and calculating JSD between pair of different species spectra. For\neach task MIA saved tables and graphics in the local disk, easily accessible for \nfuture analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our tests revealed that the \"informational model free\" spectra may\nrepresent species signatures. Since JSD applied to Horizontal Mutual Information \nspectra resulted in statistically significant distances between species, we could\ncalculate respective hierarchical clusters, herein called Informational\nDendrograms (ID). When compared to phylogenetic trees all Informational\nDendrograms presented similar taxonomy and species clusterization.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0837-0 \nPMCID: PMC4676106\nPMID: 26652707  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The recent development of whole exome\nsequencing enrichment designs for several non-model species created the need for \na species-independent, fast and versatile analysis tool, capable of tackling a\nwide variety of standard and more complex inheritance models. With this aim, we\ndeveloped \"Mendelian\", an R-package that can be used for heuristic variant\nfiltering.\nRESULTS: The R-package Mendelian offers fast and convenient filters to analyze\nputative variants for both recessive and dominant models of inheritance, with\nvariable degrees of penetrance and detectance. Analysis of trios is supported.\nFiltering against variant databases and annotation of variants is also included. \nThis package is not species specific and supports parallel computation. We\nvalidated this package by reanalyzing data from a whole exome sequencing\nexperiment on intellectual disability in humans. In a second example, we\nidentified the mutations responsible for coat color in the dog. This is the first\nexample of whole exome sequencing without prior mapping in the dog.\nCONCLUSION: We developed an R-package that enables the identification of\ndisease-causing variants from the long list of variants called in sequencing\nexperiments.

These approaches are\nnot appropriate to assess the performance of combinatorial and probabilistic\nmethods that look for coevolving positions in nucleotide or amino acid sequences.\nRESULTS: We have developed a web-based platform that gives a user-friendly access\nto two phylogenetic-based methods implementing the Coev model: the evaluation of \ncoevolving scores and the simulation of coevolving positions. We have also\nextended the capabilities of the Coev model to allow for the generalization of\nthe alphabet used in the Markov model, which can now analyse both nucleotide and \namino acid data sets. The simulation of coevolving positions is novel and builds \nupon the developments of the Coev model. It allows user to simulate pairs of\ndependent nucleotide or amino acid positions.\nCONCLUSIONS: The main focus of our paper is the new simulation method we present \nfor coevolving positions.

One of the experimental\ntechniques for γH2AX detection in cultured cells is immunofluorescent labelling\nof γH2AX and nuclei followed by microscopy imaging and analysis.\nRESULTS: In this study, we present the algorithm FoCo for reliable and robust\nautomatic nuclear foci counting in single cell images. FoCo has the following\nadvantages with respect to other software packages: i) the ability to reliably\nquantify even densely distributed foci, e.g., on images of cells subjected to\nradiation doses up to 10 Gy, ii) robustness of foci quantification in the sense\nof suppressing out-of-focus background signal, and iii) its simplicity.

Computational analyses of protein-DNA\ninteractions rely on experimental data characterizing known protein-DNA\ninteractions structurally and biochemically. While many databases exist that\ncontain either structural or biochemical data, few integrate these two data\nsources in a unified fashion. Such integration is becoming increasingly critical \nwith the rapid growth of structural and biochemical data, and the emergence of\nalgorithms that rely on the synthesis of multiple data types to derive\ncomputational models of molecular interactions.\nDESCRIPTION: We have developed an integrated affinity-structure database in which\nthe experimental and quantitative DNA binding affinities of helix-turn-helix\nproteins are mapped onto the crystal structures of the corresponding protein-DNA \ncomplexes. This database provides access to: (i) protein-DNA structures, (ii)\nquantitative summaries of protein-DNA binding affinities using position weight\nmatrices, and (iii) raw experimental data of protein-DNA binding instances.\nCritically, this database establishes a correspondence between experimental\nstructural data and quantitative binding affinity data at the single basepair\nlevel. Furthermore, we present a novel alignment algorithm that structurally\naligns the protein-DNA complexes in the database and creates a unified\nresidue-level coordinate system for comparing the physico-chemical environments\nat the interface between complexes. Using this unified coordinate system, we\ncompute the statistics of atomic interactions at the protein-DNA interface of\nhelix-turn-helix proteins. We provide an interactive website for visualization,\nquerying, and analyzing this database, and a downloadable version to facilitate\nprogrammatic analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: This database will facilitate the analysis of protein-DNA\ninteractions and the development of programmatic computational methods that\ncapitalize on integration of structural and biochemical datasets.

The purpose \nof the study was to apply a supervised data analysis strategy in a context where \nprior knowledge is available, i.e., that of hemolysis-related miRNAs\nderegulation, so as to compare our results with existing evidence.\nRESULTS: We developed a structured strategy with innovative applications of\nexisting bioinformatics methods for supervised analyses including: 1) the\ncombination of two statistical (t- and Anderson-Darling) test results to detect\nmiRNAs with significant fold change or general distributional differences in\nclass comparison, which could reveal hidden differential biological processes\nworth to be considered for building predictive tools; 2) a bootstrap selection\nprocedure together with machine learning techniques in class prediction to\nguarantee the transferability of results and explore the interconnections among\nthe selected miRNAs, which is important for highlighting their inherent\nbiological dependences. The strategy was applied to develop a classifier for\ndiscriminating between hemolyzed and not hemolyzed plasma samples, defined\naccording to a recently published hemolysis score. We identified five miRNAs with\nincreased expression in hemolyzed plasma samples (miR-486-5p, miR-92a, miR-451,\nmiR-16, miR-22).\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified four miRNAs previously reported in the literature as\nhemolysis related together with a new one (miR-22).which needs further\ninvestigations. Our findings confirm the validity of the proposed strategy and,\nin parallel, the hemolysis score capability to be used as pre-analytic hemolysis \ndetector.

Reasons for this \nsuccess story are their simplicity and clarity. The number of inferred and\npublished motifs grows with the number of data sets and motif extraction\nalgorithms. Hence, it becomes more and more important to perceive differences\nbetween motifs. However, motif differences are hard to detect from individual\nsequence logos in case of multiple motifs for one transcription factor, highly\nsimilar binding motifs of different transcription factors, or multiple motifs for\none protein domain.\nRESULTS: Here, we present DiffLogo, a freely available, extensible, and\nuser-friendly R package for visualizing motif differences. DiffLogo is capable of\nshowing differences between DNA motifs as well as protein motifs in a pair-wise\nmanner resulting in publication-ready figures. In case of more than two motifs,\nDiffLogo is capable of visualizing pair-wise differences in a tabular form. Here,\nthe motifs are ordered by similarity, and the difference logos are colored for\nclarity. We demonstrate the benefit of DiffLogo on CTCF motifs from different\nhuman cell lines, on E-box motifs of three basic helix-loop-helix transcription\nfactors as examples for comparison of DNA motifs, and on F-box domains from three\ndifferent families as example for comparison of protein motifs.\nCONCLUSIONS: DiffLogo provides an intuitive visualization of motif differences.\nIt enables the illustration and investigation of differences between highly\nsimilar motifs such as binding patterns of transcription factors for different\ncell types, treatments, and algorithmic approaches.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0767-x \nPMCID: PMC4650857\nPMID: 26577052  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

When the sequencing is done at high coverage depth (\"deep\nsequencing\"), low frequency variants can be detected. Here we present QQ-SNV\n(http://sourceforge.net/projects/qqsnv), a logistic regression classifier model\ndeveloped for the Illumina sequencing platforms that uses the quantiles of the\nquality scores, to distinguish true single nucleotide variants from sequencing\nerrors based on the estimated SNV probability. To train the model, we created a\ndataset of an in silico mixture of five HIV-1 plasmids. Testing of our method in \ncomparison to the existing methods LoFreq, ShoRAH, and V-Phaser 2 was performed\non two HIV and four HCV plasmid mixture datasets and one influenza H1N1 clinical \ndataset.\nRESULTS: For default application of QQ-SNV, variants were called using a SNV\nprobability cutoff of 0.5 (QQ-SNV(D)). To improve the sensitivity we used a SNV\nprobability cutoff of 0.0001 (QQ-SNV(HS)). To also increase specificity, SNVs\ncalled were overruled when their frequency was below the 80(th) percentile\ncalculated on the distribution of error frequencies (QQ-SNV(HS-P80)). When\ncomparing QQ-SNV versus the other methods on the plasmid mixture test sets,\nQQ-SNV(D) performed similarly to the existing approaches. QQ-SNV(HS) was more\nsensitive on all test sets but with more false positives. QQ-SNV(HS-P80) was\nfound to be the most accurate method over all test sets by balancing sensitivity \nand specificity. When applied to a paired-end HCV sequencing study, with lowest\nspiked-in true frequency of 0.5%, QQ-SNV(HS-P80) revealed a sensitivity of 100%\n(vs. 40-60% for the existing methods) and a specificity of 100% (vs. 98.0-99.7%\nfor the existing methods). In addition, QQ-SNV required the least overall\ncomputation time to process the test sets. Finally, when testing on a clinical\nsample, four putative true variants with frequency below 0.5% were consistently\ndetected by QQ-SNV(HS-P80) from different generations of Illumina sequencers.\nCONCLUSIONS: We developed and successfully evaluated a novel method, called\nQQ-SNV, for highly efficient single nucleotide variant calling on Illumina deep\nsequencing virology data.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0812-9 \nPMCID: PMC4641353\nPMID: 26554718  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, there are only few multi-centre\nclinical studies, mostly performed on a single scanner model or data format, as\nthere is no flexible way of documenting and exchanging processed magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy data in digital format. This is because the DICOM standard\nfor spectroscopy deals with unprocessed data. This paper proposes a plugin tool\ndeveloped for jMRUI, namely jMRUI2XML, to tackle the latter limitation. jMRUI is \na software tool for magnetic resonance spectroscopy data processing that is\nwidely used in the magnetic resonance spectroscopy community and has evolved into\na plugin platform allowing for implementation of novel features.\nRESULTS: jMRUI2XML is a Java solution that facilitates common preprocessing of\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy data across multiple scanners. Its main\ncharacteristics are: 1) it automates magnetic resonance spectroscopy\npreprocessing, and 2) it can be a platform for outputting exchangeable magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy data. The plugin works with any kind of data that can be\nopened by jMRUI and outputs in extensible markup language format. Data processing\ntemplates can be generated and saved for later use. The output format opens the\nway for easy data sharing- due to the documentation of the preprocessing\nparameters and the intrinsic anonymization--for example for performing pattern\nrecognition analysis on multicentre/multi-manufacturer magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy data.\nCONCLUSIONS: jMRUI2XML provides a self-contained and self-descriptive format\naccounting for the most relevant information needed for exchanging magnetic\nresonance spectroscopy data in digital form, as well as for automating its\nprocessing. This allows for tracking the procedures the data has undergone, which\nmakes the proposed tool especially useful when performing pattern recognition\nanalysis. Moreover, this work constitutes a first proposal for a minimum amount\nof information that should accompany any magnetic resonance processed spectrum,\ntowards the goal of achieving better transferability of magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy studies.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0796-5 \nPMCID: PMC4640235\nPMID: 26552737  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Feature subset selection--a sub-field of\nmachine learning--can also provide a unique insight into the differences between \nmetagenomic or 16S phenotypes.

For example, in a \nprevious study we have used information-theoretic feature selection to understand\nthe differences between protein family abundances that best discriminate between \nage groups in the human gut microbiome.\nRESULTS: We have developed a new Python command line tool, which is compatible\nwith the widely adopted BIOM format, for microbial ecologists that implements\ninformation-theoretic subset selection methods for biological data formats.

Cluster analysis\nis usually performed using a phylogenetic approach whereby clusters are assigned \non the basis of sufficiently small genetic distances and high bootstrap support\n(or posterior probabilities). The computational burden involved in this\nphylogenetic threshold approach is a major drawback, especially when a large\nnumber of sequences are being considered. In addition, this method requires a\nskilled user to specify the appropriate threshold values which may vary widely\ndepending on the application.\nRESULTS: This paper presents the Gap Procedure, a distance-based clustering\nalgorithm for the classification of DNA sequences sampled from individuals\ninfected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Our heuristic\nalgorithm bypasses the need for phylogenetic reconstruction, thereby supporting\nthe quick analysis of large genetic data sets. Moreover, this fully automated\nprocedure relies on data-driven gaps in sorted pairwise distances to infer\nclusters, thus no user-specified threshold values are required. The clustering\nresults obtained by the Gap Procedure on both real and simulated data, closely\nagree with those found using the threshold approach, while only requiring a\nfraction of the time to complete the analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Apart from the dramatic gains in computational time, the Gap\nProcedure is highly effective in finding distinct groups of genetically similar\nsequences and obviates the need for subjective user-specified values. The\nclusters of genetically similar sequences returned by this procedure can be used \nto detect patterns in HIV-1 transmission and thereby aid in the prevention,\ntreatment and containment of the disease.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0791-x \nPMCID: PMC4634160\nPMID: 26538192  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In this second phase, we release a new server-side\nspecification to accept anonymous philantropic storage donations by the general\npublic, wherein a small portion of each user's local disk may be used for\narchival of scientific data. We have implementated the server-side announcement\nand control portions of this BitTorrent extension into v3.0.0 of the BitTorious\nportal, upon which compatible clients may be built.\nRESULTS: Automated test cases for the BitTorious Volunteer extensions have been\nadded to the portal's v3.0.0 release, supporting validation of the \"peer\naffinity\" concept and announcement protocol introduced by this specification.\nAdditionally, a separate reference implementation of affinity calculation has\nbeen provided in C++ for informaticians wishing to integrate into\nlibtorrent-based projects.\nCONCLUSIONS: The BitTorrent \"affinity\" extensions as provided in the BitTorious\nportal reference implementation allow data publishers to crowdsource the extreme \nstorage prerequisites for research in \"big data\" fields.

Although several machine learning methods have been proposed to\npredict side effects, there is still space for improvements. Firstly, the side\neffect prediction is a multi-label learning task, and we can adopt the\nmulti-label learning techniques for it. Secondly, drug-related features are\nassociated with side effects, and feature dimensions have specific biological\nmeanings. Recognizing critical dimensions and reducing irrelevant dimensions may \nhelp to reveal the causes of side effects.\nMETHODS: In this paper, we propose a novel method 'feature selection-based\nmulti-label k-nearest neighbor method' (FS-MLKNN), which can simultaneously\ndetermine critical feature dimensions and construct high-accuracy multi-label\nprediction models.\nRESULTS: Computational experiments demonstrate that FS-MLKNN leads to good\nperformances as well as explainable results. To achieve better performances, we\nfurther develop the ensemble learning model by integrating individual\nfeature-based FS-MLKNN models. When compared with other state-of-the-art methods,\nthe ensemble method produces better performances on benchmark datasets.\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, FS-MLKNN and the ensemble method are promising tools \nfor the side effect prediction.

Image based analysis of such structures is often \nlimited to qualitative evaluation by human experts, hampering the throughput,\nrepeatability and reliability of the analyses. Software tools are not readily\navailable for this purpose and the existing methods typically rely at least\npartly on manual operation.\nRESULTS: We developed CytoSpectre, an automated tool based on spectral analysis, \nallowing the quantification of orientation and also size distributions of\nstructures in microscopy images. CytoSpectre utilizes the Fourier transform to\nestimate the power spectrum of an image and based on the spectrum, computes\nparameter values describing, among others, the mean orientation, isotropy and\nsize of target structures. The analysis can be further tuned to focus on targets \nof particular size at cellular or subcellular scales. The software can be\noperated via a graphical user interface without any programming expertise. We\nanalyzed the performance of CytoSpectre by extensive simulations using artificial\nimages, by benchmarking against FibrilTool and by comparisons with manual\nmeasurements performed for real images by a panel of human experts. The software \nwas found to be tolerant against noise and blurring and superior to FibrilTool\nwhen analyzing realistic targets with degraded image quality. The analysis of\nreal images indicated general good agreement between computational and manual\nresults while also revealing notable expert-to-expert variation. Moreover, the\nexperiment showed that CytoSpectre can handle images obtained of different cell\ntypes using different microscopy techniques. Finally, we studied the effect of\nmechanical stretching on cardiomyocytes to demonstrate the software in an actual \nexperiment and observed changes in cellular orientation in response to\nstretching.\nCONCLUSIONS: CytoSpectre, a versatile, easy-to-use software tool for spectral\nanalysis of microscopy images was developed. The tool is compatible with most 2D \nimages and can be used to analyze targets at different scales. We expect the tool\nto be useful in diverse applications dealing with structures whose orientation\nand size distributions are of interest. While designed for the biological field, \nthe software could also be useful in non-biological applications.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0782-y \nPMCID: PMC4624586\nPMID: 26503371  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, existing software tools for detecting intra-individual\nSNPs and InDels in direct amplicon sequencing of diploid samples are insufficient\nin analyzing single traces and their accuracy is still limited.\nRESULTS: We developed a novel computation tool, named DiSNPindel, to improve the \ndetection of intra-individual SNPs and InDels in direct amplicon sequencing of a \ndiploid. Neither reference sequence nor additional sample was required. Using two\nreal datasets, we demonstrated the usefulness of DiSNPindel in its ability to\nimprove largely the true SNP and InDel discovery rates and reduce largely the\nmissed and false positive rates as compared with existing detection methods.\nCONCLUSIONS: The software DiSNPindel presented here provides an efficient tool\nfor intra-individual SNP and InDel detection in diploid amplicon sequencing. It\nwill also be useful for identification of DNA variations in expressed sequence\ntag (EST) re-sequencing.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0790-y \nPMCID: PMC4619477\nPMID: 26498606  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Accurate expression measurement from the millions or billions of\nshort generated reads is obstructed by difficulties. One is ambiguous mapping of \nreads to reference transcriptome caused by alternative splicing. This increases\nthe uncertainty in estimating isoform expression. The other is non-uniformity of \nread distribution along the reference transcriptome due to positional,\nsequencing, mappability and other undiscovered sources of biases. This violates\nthe uniform assumption of read distribution for many expression calculation\napproaches, such as the direct RPKM calculation and Poisson-based models. Many\nmethods have been proposed to address these difficulties. Some approaches employ \nlatent variable models to discover the underlying pattern of read sequencing.\nHowever, most of these methods make bias correction based on surrounding sequence\ncontents and share the bias models by all genes. They therefore cannot estimate\ngene- and isoform-specific biases as revealed by recent studies.\nRESULTS: We propose a latent variable model, NLDMseq, to estimate gene and\nisoform expression. Our method adopts latent variables to model the unknown\nisoforms, from which reads originate, and the underlying percentage of multiple\nspliced variants. The isoform- and exon-specific read sequencing biases are\nmodeled to account for the non-uniformity of read distribution, and are\nidentified by utilizing the replicate information of multiple lanes of a single\nlibrary run. We employ simulation and real data to verify the performance of our \nmethod in terms of accuracy in the calculation of gene and isoform expression.\nResults show that NLDMseq obtains competitive gene and isoform expression\ncompared to popular alternatives. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the \ndetection of differential expression (DE) to show its usefulness in the\ndownstream analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed NLDMseq method provides an approach to accurately\nestimate gene and isoform expression from RNA-Seq data by modeling the isoform-\nand exon-specific read sequencing biases. It makes use of a latent variable model\nto discover the hidden pattern of read sequencing. We have shown that it works\nwell in both simulations and real datasets, and has competitive performance\ncompared to popular methods. The method has been implemented as a freely\navailable software which can be found at https://github.com/PUGEA/NLDMseq.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0750-6 \nPMCID: PMC4609108\nPMID: 26475308  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Despite its\nsensitivity, a greater time complexity associated with the Smith-Waterman\nalgorithm prevents its application to the all-pairs comparisons of base\nsequences, which aids in the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees. The aim\nof this study is to achieve greater acceleration using the Smith-Waterman\nalgorithm (by realizing interpair block pruning and band optimization) compared\nwith that achieved using a previous method that performs intrapair block pruning \non graphics processing units (GPUs).\nRESULTS: We present an interpair optimization method for the Smith-Waterman\nalgorithm with the aim of accelerating the all-pairs comparison of base\nsequences. Given the results of the pairs of sequences, our method realizes\nefficient block pruning by computing a lower bound for other pairs that have not \nyet been processed. This lower bound is further used for band optimization. We\nintegrated our interpair optimization method into SW#, a previous GPU-based\nimplementation that employs variants of a banded Smith-Waterman algorithm and a\nbanded Myers-Miller algorithm. Evaluation using the six genomes of Bacillus\nanthracis shows that our method pruned 88% of the matrix cells on a single GPU\nand 73% of the matrix cells on two GPUs. For the genomes of the human chromosome \n21, the alignment performance reached 202 giga-cell updates per second (GCUPS) on\ntwo Tesla K40 GPUs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Efficient interpair pruning and band optimization makes it possible \nto complete the all-pairs comparisons of the sequences of the same species 1.2\ntimes faster than the intrapair pruning method. This acceleration was achieved at\nthe first phase of SW#, where our method significantly improved the initial lower\nbound. However, our interpair optimization was not effective for the comparison\nof the sequences of different species such as comparing human, chimpanzee, and\ngorilla. Consequently, our method is useful in accelerating the applications that\nrequire optimal local alignments scores for the same species.

A systematic method to drug \nrepositioning is to identify candidate drug's gene expression profiles on target \ndisease models and determine how similar these profiles are to approved drugs.\nDatabases such as the CMAP have been developed recently to help with systematic\ndrug repositioning.\nMETHODS: To overcome the limitation of connectivity maps on data coverage, we\nconstructed a comprehensive in silico drug-protein connectivity map called DMAP, \nwhich contains directed drug-to-protein effects and effect scores. The\ndrug-to-protein effect scores are compiled from all database entries between the \ndrug and protein have been previously observed and provide a confidence measure\non the quality of such drug-to-protein effects.\nRESULTS: In DMAP, we have compiled the direct effects between 24,121 PubChem\nCompound ID (CID), which were mapped from 289,571 chemical entities recognized\nfrom public literature, and 5,196 reviewed Uniprot proteins. DMAP compiles a\ntotal of 438,004 chemical-to-protein effect relationships. Compared to CMAP, DMAP\nshows an increase of 221 folds in the number of chemicals and 1.92 fold in the\nnumber of ATC codes. Furthermore, by overlapping DMAP chemicals with the approved\ndrugs with known indications from the TTD database and literature, we obtained\n982 drugs and 622 diseases; meanwhile, we only obtained 394 drugs with known\nindication from CMAP. To validate the feasibility of applying new DMAP for\nsystematic drug repositioning, we compared the performance of DMAP and the\nwell-known CMAP database on two popular computational techniques:\ndrug-drug-similarity-based method with leave-one-out validation and\nKolmogorov-Smirnov scoring based method. In drug-drug-similarity-based method,\nthe drug repositioning prediction using DMAP achieved an Area-Under-Curve (AUC)\nscore of 0.82, compared with that using CMAP, AUC = 0.64. For Kolmogorov-Smirnov \nscoring based method, with DMAP, we were able to retrieve several drug\nindications which could not be retrieved using CMAP. DMAP data can be queried\nusing the existing C2MAP server or downloaded freely at:\nhttp://bio.informatics.iupui.edu/cmaps\nCONCLUSIONS: Reliable measurements of how drug affect disease-related proteins\nare critical to ongoing drug development in the genome medicine era. We\ndemonstrated that DMAP can help drug development professionals assess\ndrug-to-protein relationship data and improve chances of success for systematic\ndrug repositioning efforts.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S13-S4 \nPMCID: PMC4597058\nPMID: 26423722  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Extended genomic regions identical by descent (IBD) in the\noffspring of consanguineous parents give rise to recessive disorders with\nidentical (homozygous) pathogenic variants in both alleles. However, many\nclinical phenotypes presenting in the offspring of consanguineous couples are\nstill of unknown etiology. Nowadays advances in High Throughput Sequencing\nprovide an excellent opportunity to achieve a molecular diagnosis or to identify \nnovel candidate genes.\nRESULTS: To exploit all available information from the family structure we\ndeveloped CATCH, an algorithm that combines genotyped SNPs of all family members \nfor the optimal detection of Runs Of Homozygosity (ROH) and exome sequencing data\nfrom one affected individual to identify putative causative variants in\nconsanguineous families.\nCONCLUSIONS: CATCH proved to be effective in discovering known or putative new\ncausative variants in 43 out of 50 consanguineous families. Among them, novel\nvariants causative of familial thrombocytopenia, sclerosis bone dysplasia and the\nfirst homozygous loss-of-function mutation in FGFR3 in human causing severe\nskeletal deformities, tall stature and hearing impairment were identified.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0727-5 \nPMCID: PMC4587650\nPMID: 26415661  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Gene\nco-expression, which is mostly detected via the Pearson correlation coefficient, \nhas played an important role in the discovery of molecular pathways and networks.\nUnfortunately, the presence of systematic noise in high-dimensional microarray\ndatasets corrupts estimates of gene co-expression. Removing systematic noise from\nmicroarray data is therefore crucial. Many cleaning approaches for microarray\ndata exist, however these methods are aimed towards improving differential\nexpression analysis and their performances have been primarily tested for this\napplication. To our knowledge, the performances of these approaches have never\nbeen systematically compared in the context of gene co-expression estimation.\nRESULTS: Using simulations we demonstrate that standard cleaning procedures, such\nas background correction and quantile normalization, fail to adequately remove\nsystematic noise that affects gene co-expression and at times further degrade\ntrue gene co-expression. Instead we show that a global version of removal of\nunwanted variation (RUV), a data-driven approach, removes systematic noise but\nalso allows the estimation of the true underlying gene-gene correlations. We\ncompare the performance of all noise removal methods when applied to five large\npublished datasets on gene expression in the human brain. RUV retrieves the\nhighest gene co-expression values for sets of genes known to interact, but also\nprovides the greatest consistency across all five datasets. We apply the method\nto prioritize epileptic encephalopathy candidate genes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work raises serious concerns about the quality of many published\ngene co-expression analyses. RUV provides an efficient and flexible way to remove\nsystematic noise from high-dimensional microarray datasets when the objective is \ngene co-expression analysis. The RUV method as applicable in the context of\ngene-gene correlation estimation is available as a BioconductoR-package: RUVcorr.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0745-3 \nPMCID: PMC4583191\nPMID: 26403471  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the DNA profiles from such evidence\nare frequently incomplete and can contain contributions from multiple\nindividuals. The complexity of such samples confounds the assessment of the\nstatistical weight of such evidence. One approach to account for this uncertainty\nis to use a likelihood ratio framework to compare the probability of the evidence\nprofile under different scenarios. While researchers favor the likelihood ratio\nframework, few open-source software solutions with a graphical user interface\nimplementing these calculations are available for practicing forensic scientists.\nRESULTS: To address this need, we developed Lab Retriever, an open-source, freely\navailable program that forensic scientists can use to calculate likelihood ratios\nfor complex DNA profiles. Lab Retriever adds a graphical user interface, written \nprimarily in JavaScript, on top of a C++ implementation of the previously\npublished R code of Balding. We redesigned parts of the original Balding\nalgorithm to improve computational speed. In addition to incorporating a\nprobability of allelic drop-out and other critical parameters, Lab Retriever\ncomputes likelihood ratios for hypotheses that can include up to four unknown\ncontributors to a mixed sample. These computations are completed nearly\ninstantaneously on a modern PC or Mac computer.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lab Retriever provides a practical software solution to forensic\nscientists who wish to assess the statistical weight of evidence for complex DNA \nprofiles. Executable versions of the program are freely available for Mac OSX and\nWindows operating systems.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0740-8 \nPMCID: PMC4575494\nPMID: 26384762  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This \ntriggered the need for more efficient methods than general purpose compression\ntools, such as the widely used gzip method.\nRESULTS: We present a novel reference-free method meant to compress data issued\nfrom high throughput sequencing technologies. Our approach, implemented in the\nsoftware LEON, employs techniques derived from existing assembly principles. The \nmethod is based on a reference probabilistic de Bruijn Graph, built de novo from \nthe set of reads and stored in a Bloom filter. Each read is encoded as a path in \nthis graph, by memorizing an anchoring kmer and a list of bifurcations. The same \nprobabilistic de Bruijn Graph is used to perform a lossy transformation of the\nquality scores, which allows to obtain higher compression rates without losing\npertinent information for downstream analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS: LEON was run on various real sequencing datasets (whole genome,\nexome, RNA-seq or metagenomics). In all cases, LEON showed higher overall\ncompression ratios than state-of-the-art compression software. On a C. elegans\nwhole genome sequencing dataset, LEON divided the original file size by more than\n20.

In particular, the ability of conformational changes, which can be\nencoded in designer RNAs, enables us to create multistable molecular switches\nthat function in biological circuits. Although various algorithms for designing\nsuch RNA switches have been proposed, the previous algorithms optimize the RNA\nsequences against the weighted sum of objective functions, where empirical\nweights among objective functions are used. In addition, an RNA design algorithm \nfor multiple pseudoknot targets is currently not available.\nRESULTS: We developed a novel computational tool for automatically designing RNA \nsequences which fold into multiple target secondary structures. Our algorithm\ndesigns RNA sequences based on multi-objective genetic algorithm, by which we can\nexplore the RNA sequences having good objective function values without empirical\nweight parameters among the objective functions. Our algorithm has great\nflexibility by virtue of this weight-free nature. We benchmarked our multi-target\nRNA design algorithm with the datasets of two, three, and four target structures \nand found that our algorithm shows better or comparable design performances\ncompared with the previous algorithms, RNAdesign and Frnakenstein. In addition to\nthe benchmarks with pseudoknot-free datasets, we benchmarked MODENA with\ntwo-target pseudoknot datasets and found that MODENA can design the RNAs which\nhave the target pseudoknotted secondary structures whose free energies are close \nto the lowest free energy. Moreover, we applied our algorithm to a ribozyme-based\nON-switch which takes a ribozyme-inactive secondary structure when the\ntheophylline aptamer structure is assumed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Currently, MODENA is the only RNA design software which can be\napplied to multiple pseudoknot targets. Successful design results for the\nmultiple targets and an RNA device indicate usefulness of our multi-objective RNA\ndesign algorithm.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0706-x \nPMCID: PMC4559319\nPMID: 26335276  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Most conventional analyses of Hi-C data focus on the\ndetection of statistically significant interactions. However, an alternative\nstrategy involves identifying significant changes in the interaction intensity\n(i.e., differential interactions) between two or more biological conditions. This\nis more statistically rigorous and may provide more biologically relevant\nresults.\nRESULTS: Here, we present the diffHic software package for the detection of\ndifferential interactions from Hi-C data. diffHic provides methods for read pair \nalignment and processing, counting into bin pairs, filtering out low-abundance\nevents and normalization of trended or CNV-driven biases. It uses the statistical\nframework of the edgeR package to model biological variability and to test for\nsignificant differences between conditions. Several options for the visualization\nof results are also included. The use of diffHic is demonstrated with real Hi-C\ndata sets. Performance against existing methods is also evaluated with simulated \ndata.\nCONCLUSIONS: On real data, diffHic is able to successfully detect interactions\nwith significant differences in intensity between biological conditions.

Biological time series may contain (multiple) unknown\nsignal shapes of systemic relevance, imperfections like noise, damping, and\ntrending, or limited sampling density. While there exist methods for detecting\nperiodicity, their design biases (e.g. toward a specific signal shape) can limit \ntheir applicability in one or more of these situations.\nMETHODS: We present in this paper a novel method, SW1PerS, for quantifying\nperiodicity in time series in a shape-agnostic manner and with resistance to\ndamping. The measurement is performed directly, without presupposing a particular\npattern, by evaluating the circularity of a high-dimensional representation of\nthe signal. SW1PerS is compared to other algorithms using synthetic data and\nperformance is quantified under varying noise models, noise levels, sampling\ndensities, and signal shapes. Results on biological data are also analyzed and\ncompared.\nRESULTS: On the task of periodic/not-periodic classification, using synthetic\ndata, SW1PerS outperforms all other algorithms in the low-noise regime. SW1PerS\nis shown to be the most shape-agnostic of the evaluated methods, and the only one\nto consistently classify damped signals as highly periodic. On biological data,\nand for several experiments, the lists of top 10% genes ranked with SW1PerS\nrecover up to 67% of those generated with other popular algorithms. Moreover, the\nlist of genes from data on the Yeast metabolic cycle which are highly-ranked only\nby SW1PerS, contains evidently non-cosine patterns (e.g. ECM33, CDC9, SAM1,2 and \nMSH6) with highly periodic expression profiles. In data from the Yeast cell cycle\nSW1PerS identifies genes not preferred by other algorithms, hence not previously \nreported as periodic, but found in other experiments such as the universal growth\nrate response of Slavov. These genes are BOP3, CDC10, YIL108W, YER034W, MLP1,\nPAC2 and RTT101.\nCONCLUSIONS: In biological systems with low noise, i.e. where periodic signals\nwith interesting shapes are more likely to occur, SW1PerS can be used as a\npowerful tool in exploratory analyses. Indeed, by having an initial set of\nperiodic genes with a rich variety of signal types, pattern/shape information can\nbe included in the study of systems and the generation of hypotheses regarding\nthe structure of gene regulatory networks.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0645-6 \nPMCID: PMC4537550\nPMID: 26277424  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A common task in molecular biology is to infer functional, structural\nor evolutionary relationships by querying a database using an algorithm. However,\nproblems arise when sequence similarity is low. This study presents an algorithm \nthat uses the evolutionary rate at codon sites, the dN/dS (ω) parameter, coupled \nto a substitution matrix as an alignment metric for detecting distantly related\nproteins. The algorithm, called BLOSUM-FIRE couples a newer and improved version \nof the original FIRE (Functional Inference using Rates of Evolution) algorithm\nwith an amino acid substitution matrix in a dynamic scoring function. The\nenigmatic hepatitis B virus X protein was used as a test case for BLOSUM-FIRE and\nits associated database EvoDB.\nRESULTS: The evolutionary rate based approach was coupled with a conventional\nBLOSUM substitution matrix. The two approaches are combined in a dynamic scoring \nfunction, which uses the selective pressure to score aligned residues. The\ndynamic scoring function is based on a coupled additive approach that scores\naligned sites based on the level of conservation inferred from the ω values.\nEvaluation of the accuracy of this new implementation, BLOSUM-FIRE, using MAFFT\nalignment as reference alignments has shown that it is more accurate than its\npredecessor FIRE. Comparison of the alignment quality with widely used algorithms\n(MUSCLE, T-COFFEE, and CLUSTAL Omega) revealed that the BLOSUM-FIRE algorithm\nperforms as well as conventional algorithms. Its main strength lies in that it\nprovides greater potential for aligning divergent sequences and addresses the\nproblem of low specificity inherent in the original FIRE algorithm. The utility\nof this algorithm is demonstrated using the Hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein, a \nprotein of unknown function, as a test case.\nCONCLUSION: This study describes the utility of an evolutionary rate based\napproach coupled to the BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix in inferring\nprotein domain function. We demonstrate that such an approach is robust and\nperforms as well as an array of conventional algorithms.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0688-8 \nPMCID: PMC4535666\nPMID: 26269100  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This is also a way to identify the species of origin of the sequence.\nThe quality of the reference database used in such analyses is crucial: the\ndatabase must reflect the up-to-date bacterial nomenclature and accurately\nindicate the species of origin of its sequences.\nDESCRIPTION: leBIBI(QBPP) is a web tool taking as input a series of nucleotide\nsequences belonging to one of a set of reference markers (e.g., SSU rRNA, rpoB,\ngroEL2) and automatically retrieving closely related sequences, aligning them,\nand performing phylogenetic reconstruction using an approximate maximum\nlikelihood approach. The system returns a set of quality parameters and, if\npossible, a suggested taxonomic assigment for the input sequences. The reference \ndatabases are extracted from GenBank and present four degrees of stringency, from\nthe \"superstringent\" degree (one type strain per species) to the loosely parsed\ndegree (\"lax\" database). A set of one hundred to more than a thousand sequences\nmay be analyzed at a time. The speed of the process has been optimized through\ncareful hardware selection and database design.\nCONCLUSION: leBIBI(QBPP) is a powerful tool helping biologists to position\nbacterial or archaeal sequence commonly used markers in a phylogeny. It is a\ndiagnostic tool for clinical, industrial and environmental microbiology\nlaboratory, as well as an exploratory tool for more specialized laboratories. Its\nmain advantages, relatively to comparable systems are: i) the use of a broad set \nof databases covering diverse markers with various degrees of stringency; ii) the\nuse of an approximate Maximum Likelihood approach for phylogenetic\nreconstruction; iii) a speed compatible with on-line usage; and iv) providing\nfully documented results to help the user in decision making.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0692-z \nPMCID: PMC4531848\nPMID: 26264559  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Thus determining\nthe clinical significance of each nsSNP is of great importance. Potential\ndetrimental nsSNPs may be identified by genetic association studies or by\nfunctional analysis in the laboratory, both of which are expensive and time\nconsuming. Existing computational methods lack accuracy and features to\nfacilitate nsSNP classification for clinical use. We developed the GESPA (GEnomic\nSingle nucleotide Polymorphism Analyzer) program to predict the pathogenicity and\ndisease phenotype of nsSNPs.\nRESULTS: GESPA is a user-friendly software package for classifying disease\nassociation of nsSNPs. It allows flexibility in acceptable input formats and\npredicts the pathogenicity of a given nsSNP by assessing the conservation of\namino acids in orthologs and paralogs and supplementing this information with\ndata from medical literature. The development and testing of GESPA was performed \nusing the humsavar, ClinVar and humvar datasets. Additionally, GESPA also\npredicts the disease phenotype associated with a nsSNP with high accuracy, a\nfeature unavailable in existing software. GESPA's overall accuracy exceeds\nexisting computational methods for predicting nsSNP pathogenicity. The usability \nof GESPA is enhanced by fast SQL-based cloud storage and retrieval of data.\nCONCLUSIONS: GESPA is a novel bioinformatics tool to determine the pathogenicity \nand phenotypes of nsSNPs. We anticipate that GESPA will become a useful clinical \nframework for predicting the disease association of nsSNPs.

High-content screens permit a readout (e.g., \nfluorescence, luminescence, cell morphology) from each cell in the population.\nMost analysis approaches compare the average effect on each population,\nprecluding identification of outliers that affect the distribution of the\nreporter in the population but not its average. Other approaches only measure\nchanges to the distribution with a single parameter, precluding accurate\ndistinction and clustering of interesting outlier distributions.\nRESULTS: We describe a methodology to identify outlier conditions by considering \nthe cell-level measurements from each condition as a sample of an underlying\ndistribution. With appropriate selection of a distance metric, all effects can be\nembedded in a fixed-dimensionality Euclidean basis, facilitating identification\nand clustering of biologically interesting outliers. We demonstrate that\nmeasurement of distances with the Hellinger distance metric offers substantial\ncomputational efficiencies over alternative metrics. We validate this methodology\nusing an RNA interference (RNAi) screen in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) with \na Nanog reporter. The methodology clusters effects of multiple control siRNAs\ninto their true identities better than conventional approaches describing the\nmedian cell fluorescence or the commonly used Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between\nthe observed fluorescence distribution and the null distribution. It identifies\noutlier genes with effects on the reporter distribution that would have been\nmissed by other methods. Among them, siRNA targeting Chek1 leads to a wider Nanog\nreporter fluorescence distribution. Similarly, siRNA targeting Med14 or Med27\nleads to a narrower Nanog reporter fluorescence distribution. We confirm the\nroles of these three genes in regulating pluripotency by mRNA expression and\nalkaline phosphatase staining using independent short hairpin (sh) RNAs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using our methodology, we describe each experimental condition by a \nprobability distribution. Measuring distances between probability distributions\npermits a multivariate rather than univariate readout. Clustering points derived \nfrom these distances allows us to obtain greater biological insight than methods \nbased solely on single parameters. We find several outliers from a mouse ESC RNAi\nscreen that we confirm to be pluripotency regulators. Many of these outliers\nwould have been missed by other analysis methods.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0636-7 \nPMCID: PMC4511455\nPMID: 26198214  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The full information about the DNA variations in the genome of an\nindividual is given by haplotypes, the ordered lists of single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) located on chromosomes. Affordable high-throughput DNA\nsequencing technologies enable routine acquisition of data needed for the\nassembly of single individual haplotypes. However, state-of-the-art\nhigh-throughput sequencing platforms generate data that is erroneous, which\ninduces uncertainty in the SNP and genotype calling procedures and, ultimately,\nadversely affect the accuracy of haplotyping. When inferring haplotype phase\ninformation, the vast majority of the existing techniques for haplotype assembly \nassume that the genotype information is correct. This motivates the development\nof methods capable of joint genotype calling and haplotype assembly.\nRESULTS: We present a haplotype assembly algorithm, ParticleHap, that relies on a\nprobabilistic description of the sequencing data to jointly infer genotypes and\nassemble the most likely haplotypes. Our method employs a deterministic\nsequential Monte Carlo algorithm that associates single nucleotide polymorphisms \nwith haplotypes by exhaustively exploring all possible extensions of the partial \nhaplotypes. The algorithm relies on genotype likelihoods rather than on often\nerroneously called genotypes, thus ensuring a more accurate assembly of the\nhaplotypes. Results on both the 1000 Genomes Project experimental data as well as\nsimulation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach enables highly accurate\nsolutions to the haplotype assembly problem while being computationally efficient\nand scalable, generally outperforming existing methods in terms of both accuracy \nand speed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The developed probabilistic framework and sequential Monte Carlo\nalgorithm enable joint haplotype assembly and genotyping in a computationally\nefficient manner. Our results demonstrate fast and highly accurate haplotype\nassembly aided by the re-examination of erroneously called genotypes.

Efficient and user-friendly tools are critical in carrying out such \nanalysis on high-throughput bisulfite sequencing data. However, existing tools\nare either not scalable well, or inadequate in providing visualization and other \ndesirable functionalities.\nRESULTS: In order to handle ultra large sequencing data and to provide additional\nfunctions and features, we have developed BSPAT, a fast online tool for bisulfite\nsequencing pattern analysis. With a user-friendly web interface, BSPAT seamlessly\nintegrates read mapping/quality control/methylation calling with methylation\npattern generation and visualization. BSPAT has the following important features:\n1) instead of using multiple/pairwise sequence alignment methods, BSPAT adopts an\nefficient and widely used sequence mapping tool to provide fast alignment of\nsequence reads; 2) BSPAT summarizes and visualizes DNA methylation co-occurrence \npatterns at a single nucleotide level, which provide valuable information in\nunderstanding the mechanism and regulation of DNA methylation; 3) based on\nmethylation co-occurrence patterns, BSPAT can automatically detect potential\nallele-specific methylation (ASM) patterns, which can greatly enhance the\ndetection and analysis of ASM patterns; 4) by linking directly with other popular\ndatabases and tools, BSPAT allows users to perform integrative analysis of\nmethylation patterns with other genomic features together within regions of\ninterest.\nCONCLUSION: By utilizing a real bisulfite sequencing dataset generated from\nprostate cancer cell lines, we have shown that BSPAT is highly efficient. It has \nalso reported some interesting methylation co-occurrence patterns and a potential\nallele-specific methylation case. In conclusion, BSPAT is an efficient and\nconvenient tool for high-throughput bisulfite sequencing data analysis that can\nbe broadly used.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0649-2 \nPMCID: PMC4499179\nPMID: 26163275  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In particular, PN allows the\ntopological analysis based on structural properties, which is important and\nuseful when quantitative (kinetic) data are incomplete or unknown. Knowing the\nkinetic parameters, the simulation of time evolution of such models can help to\nstudy the dynamic behavior of the underlying system. If the number of involved\nentities (molecules) is low, a stochastic simulation should be preferred against \nthe classical deterministic approach of solving ordinary differential equations. \nThe Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) is a common method for such\nsimulations. The combination of the qualitative and semi-quantitative PN modeling\nand stochastic analysis techniques provides a valuable approach in the field of\nsystems biology.\nRESULTS: Here, we describe the implementation of stochastic analysis in a PN\nenvironment. We extended MONALISA - an open-source software for creation,\nvisualization and analysis of PN - by several stochastic simulation methods. The \nsimulation module offers four simulation modes, among them the stochastic mode\nwith constant firing rates and Gillespie's algorithm as exact and approximate\nversions. The simulator is operated by a user-friendly graphical interface and\naccepts input data such as concentrations and reaction rate constants that are\ncommon parameters in the biological context. The key features of the simulation\nmodule are visualization of simulation, interactive plotting, export of results\ninto a text file, mathematical expressions for describing simulation parameters, \nand up to 500 parallel simulations of the same parameter sets. To illustrate the \nmethod we discuss a model for insulin receptor recycling as case study.\nCONCLUSIONS: We present a software that combines the modeling power of Petri nets\nwith stochastic simulation of dynamic processes in a user-friendly environment\nsupported by an intuitive graphical interface. The program offers a valuable\nalternative to modeling, using ordinary differential equations, especially when\nsimulating single-cell experiments with low molecule counts. The ability to use\nmathematical expressions provides an additional flexibility in describing the\nsimulation parameters. The open-source distribution allows further extensions by \nthird-party developers. The software is cross-platform and is licensed under the \nArtistic License 2.0.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0596-y \nPMCID: PMC4496887\nPMID: 26156221  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A major application of RNA-Seq is to\ndetect differential isoform expression across experimental conditions, which is\nof great biological interest due to its direct relevance to protein function and \ndisease pathogenesis. Detection of differential isoform expression is challenging\nbecause of uncertainty in isoform expression estimation owing to ambiguous reads \nand variability in precision of the estimates across samples. It is desirable to \nhave a method that can account for these issues and is flexible enough to allow\nadjustment for covariates.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we present MetaDiff, a random-effects meta-regression\nmodel that naturally fits for the above purposes. Through extensive simulations\nand analysis of an RNA-Seq dataset on human heart failure, we show that the\nrandom-effects meta-regression approach is computationally fast, reliable, and\ncan improve the power of differential expression analysis while controlling for\nfalse positives due to the effect of covariates or confounding variables. In\ncontrast, several existing methods either fail to control false discovery rate or\nhave reduced power in the presence of covariates or confounding variables. The\nsource code, compiled JAR package and documentation of MetaDiff are freely\navailable at https://github.com/jiach/MetaDiff.\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicate that random-effects meta-regression offers a\nflexible framework for differential expression analysis of isoforms, particularly\nwhen gene expression is influenced by other variables.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0623-z \nPMCID: PMC4489045\nPMID: 26134005  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

If the investigation is aimed only at the microbiome\ntaxonomic structure, a target-based metagenomic approach, here also referred as\nMeta-barcoding, is generally applied. This approach commonly involves the\nselective amplification of a species-specific genetic marker (DNA meta-barcode)\nin the whole taxonomic range of interest and the exploration of its taxon-related\nvariants through High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies. The accessibility\nto proper computational systems for the large-scale bioinformatic analysis of HTS\ndata represents, currently, one of the major challenges in advanced\nMeta-barcoding projects.\nRESULTS: BioMaS (Bioinformatic analysis of Metagenomic AmpliconS) is a new\nbioinformatic pipeline designed to support biomolecular researchers involved in\ntaxonomic studies of environmental microbial communities by a completely\nautomated workflow, comprehensive of all the fundamental steps, from raw sequence\ndata upload and cleaning to final taxonomic identification, that are absolutely\nrequired in an appropriately designed Meta-barcoding HTS-based experiment. In its\ncurrent version, BioMaS allows the analysis of both bacterial and fungal\nenvironments starting directly from the raw sequencing data from either Roche 454\nor Illumina HTS platforms, following two alternative paths, respectively. BioMaS \nis implemented into a public web service available at\nhttps://recasgateway.ba.infn.it/ and is also available in Galaxy at\nhttp://galaxy.cloud.ba.infn.it:8080 (only for Illumina data).\nCONCLUSION: BioMaS is a friendly pipeline for Meta-barcoding HTS data analysis\nspecifically designed for users without particular computing skills. A\ncomparative benchmark, carried out by using a simulated dataset suitably designed\nto broadly represent the currently known bacterial and fungal world, showed that \nBioMaS outperforms QIIME and MOTHUR in terms of extent and accuracy of deep\ntaxonomic sequence assignments.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0595-z \nPMCID: PMC4486701\nPMID: 26130132  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

MEDLINE, a primary source for \nbiomedical literature, offers access to more than 20 million citations with\nthree-quarters of a million new ones added each year. Thus it is not surprising\nto see active research in building new document retrieval and sentence retrieval \nsystems. We present Ferret, a prototype retrieval system, designed to retrieve\nand rank sentences (and their documents) conveying gene-centric relationships of \ninterest to a scientist. The prototype has several features. For example, it is\ndesigned to handle gene name ambiguity and perform query expansion. Inputs can be\na list of genes with an optional list of keywords. Sentences are retrieved across\nspecies but the species discussed in the records are identified. Results are\npresented in the form of a heat map and sentences corresponding to specific cells\nof the heat map may be selected for display. Ferret is designed to assist bio\nscientists at different stages of research from early idea exploration to\nadvanced analysis of results from bench experiments.\nRESULTS: Three live case studies in the field of plant biology are presented\nrelated to Arabidopsis thaliana. The first is to discover genes that may relate\nto the phenotype of open immature flower in Arabidopsis. The second case is about\nfinding associations reported between ethylene signaling and a set of 300+\nArabidopsis genes. The third case is on searching for potential gene targets of\nan Arabidopsis transcription factor hypothesized to be involved in plant stress\nresponses. Ferret was successful in finding valuable information in all three\ncases. In the first case the bZIP family of genes was identified. In the second\ncase sentences indicating relevant associations were found in other species such \nas potato and jasmine. In the third sentences led to new research questions about\nthe plant hormone salicylic acid.\nCONCLUSIONS: Ferret successfully retrieved relevant gene-centric sentences from\nPubMed records. The three case studies demonstrate end user satisfaction with the\nsystem.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0630-0 \nPMCID: PMC4474359\nPMID: 26091670  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, existing\nmethods of all-mappers, which aim at finding all mapping locations of each read, \nare very time consuming. The majority of existing all-mappers consist of 2 main\nparts, filtration and verification. This work significantly reduces verification \ntime, which is the dominant part of the running time.\nRESULTS: An efficient all-mapper, BitMapper, is developed based on a new\nvectorized bit-vector algorithm, which simultaneously calculates the edit\ndistance of one read to multiple locations in a given reference genome.\nExperimental results on both simulated and real data sets show that BitMapper is \nfrom several times to an order of magnitude faster than the current\nstate-of-the-art all-mappers, while achieving higher sensitivity, i.e., better\nquality solutions.\nCONCLUSIONS: We present BitMapper, which is designed to return all mapping\nlocations of raw reads containing indels as well as mismatches.

Bioinformatic pipelines \nfor comparative sequence analysis typically include procedures for (i) alignment \nquality assessment and (ii) control of sequence redundancy. An additional,\nunderassessed step is the control of the amount and distribution of missing data \nin sequence alignments. While the number of sequences available for a given gene \ntypically increases with time, the site-specific coverage of each alignment\nposition remains highly variable because of differences in sequencing and\nannotation quality, or simply because of biological variation. For any given\nalignment-based analysis, the selection of sequences thus defines a trade-off\nbetween the species representation and the quantity of sites with sufficient\ncoverage to be included in the subsequent analyses.\nRESULTS: We introduce an algorithm for the optimization of sequence alignments\naccording to the number of sequences vs. number of sites trade-off. The algorithm\nuses a guide tree to compute scores for each bipartition of the alignment,\nallowing the recursive selection of sequence subsets with optimal combinations of\nsequence and site numbers. By applying our methods to two large data sets of\nseveral thousands of gene families, we show that significant site-specific\ncoverage increases can be achieved while controlling for the species\nrepresentation.\nCONCLUSIONS: The algorithm introduced in this work allows the control of the\ndistribution of missing data in any sequence alignment by removing sequences to\nincrease the number of sites with a defined minimum coverage. We advocate that\nour missing data optimization procedure in an important step which should be\nconsidered in comparative analysis pipelines, together with alignment quality\nassessment and control of sampled diversity.

The performance of integrating DE and DC, however, remains\nunexplored.\nRESULTS: In this study, we proposed a novel analytical approach called DECODE\n(Differential Co-expression and Differential Expression) to integrate DC and DE\nanalyses of gene expression data. DECODE allows one to study the combined\nfeatures of DC and DE of each transcript between two conditions. By incorporating\ninformation of the dependency between DC and DE variables, two optimal thresholds\nfor defining substantial change in expression and co-expression are\nsystematically defined for each gene based on chi-square maximization. By using\nthese thresholds, genes can be categorized into four groups with either high or\nlow DC and DE characteristics. In this study, DECODE was applied to a large\nbreast cancer microarray data set consisted of two thousand tumor samples. By\nidentifying genes with high DE and high DC, we demonstrated that DECODE could\nimprove the detection of some functional gene sets such as those related to\nimmune system, metastasis, lipid and glucose metabolism. Further investigation on\nthe identified genes and the associated functional pathways would provide an\nadditional level of understanding of complex disease mechanism.\nCONCLUSIONS: By complementing the recent DC and the traditional DE analyses,\nDECODE is a valuable methodology for investigating biological functions of genes \nexhibiting disease-associated DE and DC combined characteristics, which may not\nbe easily revealed through DC or DE approach alone.

Recent progress \nin next-generation sequencing technologies has provided an opportunity for the\ndeep T cell receptor repertoire profiling. However, a specialised software is\nrequired for the rational analysis of massive data generated by next-generation\nsequencing.\nRESULTS: Here we introduce tcR, a new R package, representing a platform for the \nadvanced analysis of T cell receptor repertoires, which includes diversity\nmeasures, shared T cell receptor sequences identification, gene usage statistics \ncomputation and other widely used methods. The tool has proven its utility in\nrecent research studies.\nCONCLUSIONS: tcR is an R package for the advanced analysis of T cell receptor\nrepertoires after primary TR sequences extraction from raw sequencing reads.

These pressures can lead \nto pathogen-specific, ubiquitous dynamic behaviours. Understanding the\nevolutionary forces that shape these patterns is one of the key goals of\ncomputationally simulated epidemiological models. Despite the contribution of\nsuch research methods in recent years to our current understanding of pathogen\nevolution, the availability of free software tools for the general public remains\nscarce.\nRESULTS: We developed the Multilocus ANTIgenic Simulator (MANTIS) software\npackage for the R statistical environment. MANTIS can simulate and analyse\nepidemiological time-series generated under the biological assumptions of the\nstrain theory of host-pathogen systems by Gupta et al.\nCONCLUSIONS: MANTIS wraps a C/C++ ordinary-differential equations system and\nRunge-Kutta solver into a set of user-friendly R functions. These include\nroutines to numerically simulate the system and others to analyse, visualize and \nexport results. For this, the package offers its own set of time-series plotting \nand exportation functions. MANTIS's main goal is to serve as a free, ready-to-use\nacademic software tool. Its open source nature further provides an opportunity\nfor users with advanced programming skills to expand its capabilities. Here, we\ndescribe the background theory, implementation, basic functionality and usage of \nthis package.

These networks control almost every biological activity in the\ncell through interactions. The hierarchy of genes in these networks as defined by\ntheir interactions gives important insights into how these functions are\ngoverned. Accurately determining the hierarchy of genes is however a\ncomputationally difficult problem. This problem is further complicated by the\nfact that an intrinsic characteristic of regulatory networks is that the wiring\nof interactions can change over time. Determining how the hierarchy in the gene\nregulatory networks changes with dynamically evolving network topology remains to\nbe an unsolved challenge.\nRESULTS: In this study, we develop a new method, named D-HIDEN\n(Dynamic-HIerarchical DEcomposition of Networks) to find the hierarchy of the\ngenes in dynamically evolving gene regulatory network topologies. Unlike earlier \nmethods, which recompute the hierarchy from scratch when the network topology\nchanges, our method adapts the hierarchy based on the wiring of the interactions \nonly for the nodes which have the potential to move in the hierarchy.\nCONCLUSIONS: We compare D-HIDEN to five currently available hierarchical\ndecomposition methods on synthetic and real gene regulatory networks. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that D-HIDEN significantly outperforms existing methods\nin running time, accuracy, or both. Furthermore, our method is robust against\ndynamic changes in hierarchy. Our experiments on human gene regulatory networks\nsuggest that our method may be used to reconstruct hierarchy in gene regulatory\nnetworks.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0529-9 \nPMCID: PMC4450841\nPMID: 25976669  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

ISOpure is\nthe only mRNA computational purification method to date that does not require a\npaired tumour-normal sample, provides a personalized cancer profile for each\npatient, and has been tested on clinical data. Replacing mixed tumour profiles\nwith ISOpure-preprocessed cancer profiles led to better prognostic gene\nsignatures for lung and prostate cancer.\nRESULTS: To simplify the integration of ISOpure into standard R-based\nbioinformatics analysis pipelines, the algorithm has been implemented as an R\npackage. The ISOpureR package performs analogously to the original code in\nestimating the fraction of cancer cells and the patient cancer mRNA abundance\nprofile from tumour samples in four cancer datasets.\nCONCLUSIONS: The ISOpureR package estimates the fraction of cancer cells and\npersonalized patient cancer mRNA abundance profile from a mixed tumour profile.\nThis open-source R implementation enables integration into existing computational\npipelines, as well as easy testing, modification and extension of the model.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0597-x \nPMCID: PMC4429941\nPMID: 25972088  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Prior work on KB construction has three major limitations. First, \nmost biomedical KBs are manually built and curated, and cannot keep up with the\nrate at which new findings are published. Second, for automatic information\nextraction (IE), the text genre of choice has been scientific publications,\nneglecting sources like health portals and online communities. Third, most prior \nwork on IE has focused on the molecular level or chemogenomics only, like\nprotein-protein interactions or gene-drug relationships, or solely address highly\nspecific topics such as drug effects.\nRESULTS: We address these three limitations by a versatile and scalable approach \nto automatic KB construction. Using a small number of seed facts for distant\nsupervision of pattern-based extraction, we harvest a huge number of facts in an \nautomated manner without requiring any explicit training. We extend previous\ntechniques for pattern-based IE with confidence statistics, and we combine this\nrecall-oriented stage with logical reasoning for consistency constraint checking \nto achieve high precision. To our knowledge, this is the first method that uses\nconsistency checking for biomedical relations. Our approach can be easily\nextended to incorporate additional relations and constraints. We ran extensive\nexperiments not only for scientific publications, but also for encyclopedic\nhealth portals and online communities, creating different KB's based on different\nconfigurations. We assess the size and quality of each KB, in terms of number of \nfacts and precision. The best configured KB, KnowLife, contains more than 500,000\nfacts at a precision of 93% for 13 relations covering genes, organs, diseases,\nsymptoms, treatments, as well as environmental and lifestyle risk factors.\nCONCLUSION: KnowLife is a large knowledge base for health and life sciences,\nautomatically constructed from different Web sources. As a unique feature,\nKnowLife is harvested from different text genres such as scientific publications,\nhealth portals, and online communities. Thus, it has the potential to serve as\none-stop portal for a wide range of relations and use cases. To showcase the\nbreadth and usefulness, we make the KnowLife KB accessible through the health\nportal (http://knowlife.mpi-inf.mpg.de).\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0549-5 \nPMCID: PMC4448285\nPMID: 25971816  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epub\n2015 Apr 23.\n\nMICA: A fast short-read aligner that takes full advantage of Many Integrated Core\nArchitecture (MIC).\n\nLuo R, Cheung J, Wu E, Wang H, Chan SH, Law WC, He G, Yu C, Liu CM, Zhou D, Li Y,\nLi R, Wang J, Zhu X, Peng S, Lam TW.\n\nBACKGROUND: Short-read aligners have recently gained a lot of speed by exploiting\nthe massive parallelism of GPU. An uprising alterative to GPU is Intel MIC;\nsupercomputers like Tianhe-2, currently top of TOP500, is built with 48,000 MIC\nboards to offer ~55 PFLOPS. The CPU-like architecture of MIC allows CPU-based\nsoftware to be parallelized easily; however, the performance is often inferior to\nGPU counterparts as an MIC card contains only ~60 cores (while a GPU card\ntypically has over a thousand cores).\nRESULTS: To better utilize MIC-enabled computers for NGS data analysis, we\ndeveloped a new short-read aligner MICA that is optimized in view of MIC's\nlimitation and the extra parallelism inside each MIC core. By utilizing the\n512-bit vector units in the MIC and implementing a new seeding strategy,\nexperiments on aligning 150 bp paired-end reads show that MICA using one MIC card\nis 4.9 times faster than BWA-MEM (using 6 cores of a top-end CPU), and slightly\nfaster than SOAP3-dp (using a GPU). Furthermore, MICA's simplicity allows very\nefficient scale-up when multiple MIC cards are used in a node (3 cards give a\n14.1-fold speedup over BWA-MEM).\nSUMMARY: MICA can be readily used by MIC-enabled supercomputers for production\npurpose. We have tested MICA on Tianhe-2 with 90 WGS samples (17.47 Tera-bases), \nwhich can be aligned in an hour using 400 nodes. MICA has impressive performance \neven though MIC is only in its initial stage of development.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MICA's source code is freely available at\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/mica-aligner under GPL v3.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary information is available as \"Additional \nFile 1\".

In order to\nunderstand better the complexity of DNA methylation landscapes in biological\nsamples, it is important to study the diversity of these methylation patterns.\nHowever, the accurate quantification of methylation patterns is subject to\nsequencing errors and spurious signals due to incomplete bisulphite conversion of\ncytosines.\nRESULTS: A statistical model is developed which accounts for the distribution of \nDNA methylation patterns at any given locus. The model incorporates the effects\nof sequencing errors and spurious reads, and enables estimation of the true\nunderlying distribution of methylation patterns.\nCONCLUSIONS: Calculation of the estimated distribution over methylation patterns \nis implemented in the R Bioconductor package MPFE.

These data sets pose new\nchallenges to statistical analysis: Variable selection becomes one of the most\nimportant tasks in this setting. Similar challenges arise if in modern data sets \nfrom observational studies, e.g., in ecology, where flexible, non-linear models\nare fitted to high-dimensional data. We assess the recently proposed flexible\nframework for variable selection called stability selection. By the use of\nresampling procedures, stability selection adds a finite sample error control to \nhigh-dimensional variable selection procedures such as Lasso or boosting. We\nconsider the combination of boosting and stability selection and present results \nfrom a detailed simulation study that provide insights into the usefulness of\nthis combination. The interpretation of the used error bounds is elaborated and\ninsights for practical data analysis are given.\nRESULTS: Stability selection with boosting was able to detect influential\npredictors in high-dimensional settings while controlling the given error bound\nin various simulation scenarios. The dependence on various parameters such as the\nsample size, the number of truly influential variables or tuning parameters of\nthe algorithm was investigated. The results were applied to investigate phenotype\nmeasurements in patients with autism spectrum disorders using a log-linear\ninteraction model which was fitted by boosting. Stability selection identified\nfive differentially expressed amino acid pathways.\nCONCLUSION: Stability selection is implemented in the freely available R package \nstabs (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stabs). It proved to work well in\nhigh-dimensional settings with more predictors than observations for both, linear\nand additive models. The original version of stability selection, which controls \nthe per-family error rate, is quite conservative, though, this is much less the\ncase for its improvement, complementary pairs stability selection. Nevertheless, \ncare should be taken to appropriately specify the error bound.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0575-3 \nPMCID: PMC4464883\nPMID: 25943565  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, this rapidly emerging field lacks dedicated\nvisualisation tools that can display features specific to epigenetic datasets.\nRESULT: We developed coMET, an R package and online tool for visualisation of\nEWAS results in a genomic region of interest. coMET generates a regional plot of \nepigenetic-phenotype association results and the estimated DNA methylation\ncorrelation between CpG sites (co-methylation), with further options to visualise\ngenomic annotations based on ENCODE data, gene tracks, reference CpG-sites, and\nuser-defined features. The tool can be used to display phenotype association\nsignals and correlation patterns of microarray or sequencing-based DNA\nmethylation data, such as Illumina Infinium 450k, WGBS, or MeDIP-seq, as well as \nother types of genomic data, such as gene expression profiles. The software is\navailable as a user-friendly online tool from http://epigen.kcl.ac.uk/comet and\nas an R Bioconductor package. Source code, examples, and full documentation are\nalso available from GitHub.\nCONCLUSION: Our new software allows visualisation of EWAS results with functional\ngenomic annotations and with estimation of co-methylation patterns. coMET is\navailable to a wide audience as an online tool and R package, and can be a\nvaluable resource to interpret results in the fast growing field of epigenetics. \nThe software is designed for epigenetic data, but can also be applied to genomic \nand functional genomic datasets in any species.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0568-2 \nPMCID: PMC4422463\nPMID: 25928765  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Only a\nsmall number of (driver) mutations occur in driver genes and are responsible for \ncarcinogenesis, while the majority of (passenger) mutations do not influence\ntumour biology. In this study, SomInaClust is introduced, a method that\naccurately identifies driver genes based on their mutation pattern across tumour \nsamples and then classifies them into oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes\nrespectively.\nRESULTS: SomInaClust starts from the observation that oncogenes mainly contain\nmutations that, due to positive selection, cluster at similar positions in a gene\nacross patient samples, whereas tumour suppressor genes contain a high number of \nprotein-truncating mutations throughout the entire gene length. The method was\nshown to prioritize driver genes in 9 different solid cancers. Furthermore it was\nfound to be complementary to existing similar-purpose methods with the additional\nadvantages that it has a higher sensitivity, also for rare mutations (occurring\nin less than 1% of all samples), and it accurately classifies candidate driver\ngenes in putative oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Pathway enrichment\nanalysis showed that the identified genes belong to known cancer signalling\npathways, and that the distinction between oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes \nis biologically relevant.\nCONCLUSIONS: SomInaClust was shown to detect candidate driver genes based on\nsomatic mutation patterns of inactivation and clustering and to distinguish\noncogenes from tumour suppressor genes. The method could be used for the\nidentification of new cancer genes or to filter mutation data for further\ndata-integration purposes.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0555-7 \nPMCID: PMC4410004\nPMID: 25903787  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Software\npackages for automated data processing are crucial to successfully process these \ndata. A variety of such software packages exist, but the outcome of data\nprocessing strongly depends on algorithm parameter settings. If they are not\ncarefully chosen, suboptimal parameter settings can easily lead to biased\nresults. Therefore, parameter settings also require optimization. Several\nparameter optimization approaches have already been proposed, but a software\npackage for parameter optimization which is free of intricate experimental\nlabeling steps, fast and widely applicable is still missing.\nRESULTS: We implemented the software package IPO ('Isotopologue Parameter\nOptimization') which is fast and free of labeling steps, and applicable to data\nfrom different kinds of samples and data from different methods of liquid\nchromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry and data from different\ninstruments. IPO optimizes XCMS peak picking parameters by using natural, stable \n(13)C isotopic peaks to calculate a peak picking score. Retention time correction\nis optimized by minimizing relative retention time differences within peak\ngroups. Grouping parameters are optimized by maximizing the number of peak groups\nthat show one peak from each injection of a pooled sample. The different\nparameter settings are achieved by design of experiments, and the resulting\nscores are evaluated using response surface models. IPO was tested on three\ndifferent data sets, each consisting of a training set and test set. IPO resulted\nin an increase of reliable groups (146% - 361%), a decrease of non-reliable\ngroups (3% - 8%) and a decrease of the retention time deviation to one third.\nCONCLUSIONS: IPO was successfully applied to data derived from liquid\nchromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry from three studies\nwith different sample types and different chromatographic methods and devices. We\nwere also able to show the potential of IPO to increase the reliability of\nmetabolomics data. The source code is implemented in R, tested on Linux and\nWindows and it is freely available for download at\nhttps://github.com/glibiseller/IPO .

The cavities have to present suitable size and\nshape, as well as appropriate chemical complementarity with ligands.\nRESULTS: We present a novel cavity prediction method that analyzes results of\nvirtual screening of specific ligands or fragment libraries by means of\nSelf-Organizing Maps. We demonstrate the method with two thoroughly studied\nproteins where it successfully identified their active sites (AS) and relevant\nsecondary binding sites (BS). Moreover, known active ligands mapped the AS better\nthan inactive ones. Interestingly, docking a naive fragment library brought even \nmore insight. We then systematically applied the method to the 102 targets from\nthe DUD-E database, where it showed a 90% identification rate of the AS among the\nfirst three consensual clusters of the SOM, and in 82% of the cases as the first \none. Further analysis by chemical decomposition of the fragments improved BS\nprediction. Chemical substructures that are representative of the active ligands \npreferentially mapped in the AS.\nCONCLUSION: The new approach provides valuable information both on relevant BSs\nand on chemical features promoting bioactivity.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0518-z \nPMCID: PMC4381396\nPMID: 25888251  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This research has generated\nlarge amounts of experimental data that is increasingly difficult to integrate\nand analyze with existing databases and domain knowledge. To address this\nchallenge, we demonstrate a scalable and effective approach for automatic\nevidence gathering and evaluation that leverages existing experimental data and\nliterature-curated facts to identify genes involved in aging and lifespan\nregulation in C. elegans.\nRESULTS: We developed a semantic knowledge base for aging by integrating data\nabout C. elegans genes from WormBase with data about 2005 human and model\norganism genes from GenAge and 149 genes from GenDR, and with the Bio2RDF network\nof linked data for the life sciences. Using HyQue (a Semantic Web tool for\nhypothesis-based querying and evaluation) to interrogate this knowledge base, we \nexamined 48,231 C. elegans genes for their role in modulating lifespan and aging.\nHyQue identified 24 novel but well-supported candidate aging-related genes for\nfurther experimental validation.\nCONCLUSIONS: We use semantic technologies to discover candidate aging genes whose\neffects on lifespan are not yet well understood.

However, downstream results may be highly sensitive to the alignment\nused, and neglecting the uncertainty in the alignment can lead to significant\nbias in the resulting inference. In recent years, a number of approaches have\nbeen developed for probabilistic sampling of alignments, rather than simply\ngenerating a single optimum. However, this type of probabilistic information is\ncurrently not widely used in the context of downstream inference, since most\nexisting algorithms are set up to make use of a single alignment.\nRESULTS: In this work we present a framework for representing a set of sampled\nalignments as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are alignment columns;\neach path through this DAG then represents a valid alignment. Since the\nprobabilities of individual columns can be estimated from empirical frequencies, \nthis approach enables sample-based estimation of posterior alignment\nprobabilities. Moreover, due to conditional independencies between columns, the\ngraph structure encodes a much larger set of alignments than the original set of \nsampled MSAs, such that the effective sample size is greatly increased.\nCONCLUSIONS: The alignment DAG provides a natural way to represent a distribution\nin the space of MSAs, and allows for existing algorithms to be efficiently scaled\nup to operate on large sets of alignments. As an example, we show how this can be\nused to compute marginal probabilities for tree topologies, averaging over a very\nlarge number of MSAs. This framework can also be used to generate a statistically\nmeaningful summary alignment; example applications show that this summary\nalignment is consistently more accurate than the majority of the alignment\nsamples, leading to improvements in downstream tree inference.

Assembling even a draft genome using de novo\napproaches can take days, even on a powerful computer, and these assemblies\ntypically require data from a variety of genomic libraries. Here we describe\nsoftware that will alleviate these issues by rapidly assembling genes from\ndistantly related taxa using a single library of paired-end reads: aTRAM,\nautomated Target Restricted Assembly Method. The aTRAM pipeline uses a reference \nsequence, BLAST, and an iterative approach to target and locally assemble the\ngenes of interest.\nRESULTS: Our results demonstrate that aTRAM rapidly assembles genes across\ndistantly related taxa. In comparative tests with a closely related taxon, aTRAM \nassembled the same sequence as reference-based and de novo approaches taking on\naverage < 1 min per gene. As a test case with divergent sequences, we assembled\n>1,000 genes from six taxa ranging from 25 - 110 million years divergent from the\nreference taxon. The gene recovery was between 97 - 99% from each taxon.\nCONCLUSIONS: aTRAM can quickly assemble genes across distantly-related taxa,\nobviating the need for draft genome assembly of all taxa of interest. Because\naTRAM uses a targeted approach, loci can be assembled in minutes depending on the\nsize of the target. Our results suggest that this software will be useful in\nrapidly assembling genes for phylogenomic projects covering a wide taxonomic\nrange, as well as other applications.

To reduce costs, sequencing of restriction enzyme based reduced\nrepresentation libraries can be utilized. This technology is generally referred\nto as Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS). To deal with GBS experimental design and\ninitial processing specific bioinformatic tools are needed.\nRESULTS: GBSX is a package that assists in selecting the appropriate enzyme and\nthe design of compatible in-line barcodes. Post sequencing, it performs optimized\ndemultiplexing using these barcodes to create fastq files per barcode which can\neasily be plugged into existing variant analysis pipelines. Here we demonstrate\nthe usability of the GBSX toolkit and demonstrate improved in-line barcode\ndemultiplexing and trimming performance compared to existing tools.\nCONCLUSIONS: GBSX provides an easy to use suite of tools for designing and\ndemultiplexing of GBS experiments.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0514-3 \nPMCID: PMC4359581\nPMID: 25887893  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In order to keep such applications up-to-date, new entities need to be \nfrequently annotated to enrich the corpus. However, this task is time-consuming\nand requires a high-level of expertise in both the domain and the related\nontology. Different strategies have thus been proposed to ease this indexing\nprocess, each one taking advantage from the features of the document.\nRESULTS: In this paper we present USI (User-oriented Semantic Indexer), a fast\nand intuitive method for indexing tasks. We introduce a solution to suggest a\nconceptual annotation for new entities based on related already indexed\ndocuments. Our results, compared to those obtained by previous authors using the \nMeSH thesaurus and a dataset of biomedical papers, show that the method surpasses\ntext-specific methods in terms of both quality and speed. Evaluations are done\nvia usual metrics and semantic similarity.\nCONCLUSIONS: By only relying on neighbor documents, the User-oriented Semantic\nIndexer does not need a representative learning set. Yet, it provides better\nresults than the other approaches by giving a consistent annotation scored with a\nglobal criterion - instead of one score per concept.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0513-4 \nPMCID: PMC4367850\nPMID: 25887746  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The resolution of QTL localization\ndepends on the number of informative recombinations in the population and how\nwell they are tagged by markers. Larger populations and denser marker maps are\nbetter for detecting and locating QTLs. Marker maps that are initially too sparse\ncan be saturated or derived de novo from high-throughput omics data, (e.g. gene\nexpression, protein or metabolite abundance). If these molecular phenotypes are\naffected by genetic variation due to a major QTL they will show a clear\nmultimodal distribution. Using this information, phenotypes can be converted into\ngenetic markers.\nRESULTS: The Pheno2Geno tool uses mixture modeling to select phenotypes and\ntransform them into genetic markers suitable for construction and/or saturation\nof a genetic map. Pheno2Geno excludes candidate genetic markers that show\nevidence for multiple possibly epistatically interacting QTL and/or interaction\nwith the environment, in order to provide a set of robust markers for follow-up\nQTL mapping. We demonstrate the use of Pheno2Geno on gene expression data of\n370,000 probes in 148 A. thaliana recombinant inbred lines. Pheno2Geno is able to\nsaturate the existing genetic map, decreasing the average distance between\nmarkers from 7.1 cM to 0.89 cM, close to the theoretical limit of 0.68 cM (with\n148 individuals we expect a recombination every 100/148=0.68 cM); this pinpointed\nalmost all of the informative recombinations in the population.\nCONCLUSION: The Pheno2Geno package makes use of genome-wide molecular profiling\nand provides a tool for high-throughput de novo map construction and saturation\nof existing genetic maps. Processing of the showcase dataset takes less than 30\nminutes on an average desktop PC. Pheno2Geno improves QTL mapping results at no\nadditional laboratory cost and with minimum computational effort. Its results are\nformatted for direct use in R/qtl, the leading R package for QTL studies.\nPheno2Geno is freely available on CRAN under \"GNU GPL v3\".

The biggest\nchallenge is the extraction of relevant information from the huge sequence\ndatasets generated for metagenomics studies.

RIEMS assigns every individual read sequence\nwithin a dataset taxonomically by cascading different sequence analyses with\ndecreasing stringency of the assignments using various software applications.\nAfter completion of the analyses, the results are summarised in a clearly\nstructured result protocol organised taxonomically. The high accuracy and\nperformance of RIEMS analyses were proven in comparison with other tools for\nmetagenomics data analysis using simulated sequencing read datasets.\nCONCLUSIONS: RIEMS has the potential to fill the gap that still exists with\nregard to data analysis for metagenomics studies.

In\nmany cases, however, a gene set-based interpretation of genomic data is desired\nin the absence of a phenotype variable. Although methods exist for unsupervised\ngene set testing, they predominantly compute enrichment relative to clusters of\nthe genomic variables with performance strongly dependent on the clustering\nalgorithm and number of clusters.\nRESULTS: We propose a novel method, spectral gene set enrichment (SGSE), for\nunsupervised competitive testing of the association between gene sets and\nempirical data sources. SGSE first computes the statistical association between\ngene sets and principal components (PCs) using our principal component gene set\nenrichment (PCGSE) method. The overall statistical association between each gene \nset and the spectral structure of the data is then computed by combining the\nPC-level p-values using the weighted Z-method with weights set to the PC variance\nscaled by Tracy-Widom test p-values. Using simulated data, we show that the SGSE \nalgorithm can accurately recover spectral features from noisy data. To illustrate\nthe utility of our method on real data, we demonstrate the superior performance\nof the SGSE method relative to standard cluster-based techniques for testing the \nassociation between MSigDB gene sets and the variance structure of microarray\ngene expression data.\nCONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised gene set testing can provide important information\nabout the biological signal held in high-dimensional genomic data sets. Because\nit uses the association between gene sets and samples PCs to generate a measure\nof unsupervised enrichment, the SGSE method is independent of cluster or network \ncreation algorithms and, most importantly, is able to utilize the statistical\nsignificance of PC eigenvalues to ignore elements of the data most likely to\nrepresent noise.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0490-7 \nPMCID: PMC4365810\nPMID: 25879888  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Ontologies are hierarchies of\nbiologically relevant groupings. Using ontology annotations, which link ontology \nclasses to biological entities, enrichment analysis methods assess whether there \nis a significant over or under representation of entities for ontology classes.\nWhile many tools exist that run enrichment analysis for protein sets annotated\nwith the Gene Ontology, there are only a few that can be used for small molecules\nenrichment analysis.\nRESULTS: We describe BiNChE, an enrichment analysis tool for small molecules\nbased on the ChEBI Ontology. BiNChE displays an interactive graph that can be\nexported as a high-resolution image or in network formats. The tool provides\nplain, weighted and fragment analysis based on either the ChEBI Role Ontology or \nthe ChEBI Structural Ontology.\nCONCLUSIONS: BiNChE aids in the exploration of large sets of small molecules\nproduced within Metabolomics or other Systems Biology research contexts.

There are a number of mature software \npackages and associated pipelines that can identify single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) with a high degree of concordance. However, the same cannot \nbe said for tools that are used to identify the other types of variants. Indels\nrepresent the second most frequent class of variants in the human genome, after\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms. The reliable detection of indels is still a\nchallenging problem, especially for variants that are longer than a few bases.\nRESULTS: We have developed a set of algorithms and heuristics collectively called\nindelMINER to identify indels from whole genome resequencing datasets using\npaired-end reads. indelMINER uses a split-read approach to identify the precise\nbreakpoints for indels of size less than a user specified threshold, and\nsupplements that with a paired-end approach to identify larger variants that are \nfrequently missed with the split-read approach. We use simulated and real\ndatasets to show that an implementation of the algorithm performs favorably when \ncompared to several existing tools.\nCONCLUSIONS: indelMINER can be used effectively to identify indels in\nwhole-genome resequencing projects. The output is provided in the VCF format\nalong with additional information about the variant, including information about \nits presence or absence in another sample.

However, quantitative models\nthat accurately predict the up or down regulation of gene expression are\ncurrently lacking.\nMETHODS: A new machine learning-based method of gene expression prediction is\ndeveloped in the context of lung cancer. This method uses the Illumina Infinium\nHumanMethylation450K Beadchip CpG methylation array data from paired lung cancer \nand adjacent normal tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and histone\nmodification marker CHIP-Seq data from the ENCODE project, to predict the\ndifferential expression of RNA-Seq data in TCGA lung cancers. It considers a\ncomprehensive list of 1424 features spanning the four categories of CpG\nmethylation, histone H3 methylation modification, nucleotide composition, and\nconservation. Various feature selection and classification methods are compared\nto select the best model over 10-fold cross-validation in the training data set.\nRESULTS: A best model comprising 67 features is chosen by ReliefF based feature\nselection and random forest classification method, with AUC = 0.864 from the\n10-fold cross-validation of the training set and AUC = 0.836 from the testing\nset. The selected features cover all four data types, with histone H3 methylation\nmodification (32 features) and CpG methylation (15 features) being most abundant.\nAmong the dropping-off tests of individual data-type based features, removal of\nCpG methylation feature leads to the most reduction in model performance. In the \nbest model, 19 selected features are from the promoter regions (TSS200 and\nTSS1500), highest among all locations relative to transcripts. Sequential\ndropping-off of CpG methylation features relative to different regions on the\nprotein coding transcripts shows that promoter regions contribute most\nsignificantly to the accurate prediction of gene expression.\nCONCLUSIONS: By considering a comprehensive list of epigenomic and genomic\nfeatures, we have constructed an accurate model to predict transcriptomic\ndifferential expression, exemplified in lung cancer.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S5-S10 \nPMCID: PMC4402699\nPMID: 25861082  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

It is of particular interest as endogenous metabolites\nrepresent the phenotype resulting from gene expression. A major challenge in\nmetabolomics research is the structural identification of unknown biochemical\ncompounds in complex biofluids. In this paper we present an efficient\ncheminformatics tool, BioSMXpress that uses known endogenous mammalian\nbiochemicals and graph matching methods to identify endogenous mammalian\nbiochemical structures in chemical structure space. The results of a\ncomprehensive set of empirical experiments suggest that BioSMXpress identifies\nendogenous mammalian biochemical structures with high accuracy. BioSMXpress is 8 \ntimes faster than our previous work BioSM without compromising the accuracy of\nthe predictions made.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the \nexpression of viral miRNAs is associated with the ability of the virus to infect \na host. Identifying potential viral miRNAs from experimental sequence data is\nvaluable for deciphering virus-host interactions. Thus far, a specific predictive\nmodel for viral miRNA identification has yet to be developed.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we present ViralmiR for identifying viral miRNA\nprecursors on the basis of sequencing and structural information. We collected\n263 experimentally validated miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) from 26 virus species \nand generated sequencing fragments from virus and human genomes as the negative\ndataset. Support vector machine and random forest models were established using\n54 features from RNA sequences and secondary structural information. The results \nshow that ViralmiR achieved a balanced accuracy higher than 83%, which is\nsuperior to that of previously developed tools for identifying pre-miRNAs.\nCONCLUSIONS: The easy-to-use ViralmiR web interface has been provided as a\nhelpful resource for researchers to use in analyzing and deciphering virus-host\ninteractions.

Current paired-end adapter removal approaches trim\nadapter by scanning the fragment of adapter on the 3' end of the reads, which are\nnot competent in some applications.\nRESULTS: Here, we propose a fast and highly accurate adapter-trimming algorithm, \nPEAT, designed specifically for paired-end sequencing.

We assessed \nthe performance of PEAT with many adapter trimmers in both simulated and real\nlife paired-end sequencing libraries. The importance of adapter trimming was\nexemplified by the influence of the downstream analyses on RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and \nMNase-seq. Several useful guidelines of applying adapter trimmers with aligners\nwere suggested.\nCONCLUSIONS: PEAT can be easily included in the routine paired-end sequencing\npipeline.

Here we detail a method\nto investigate how polymerase pausing in the Pacific Biosciences sequencer reads \ncan be related to DNA sequences. The Pacific Biosciences sequencer uses optics to\nview a polymerase and its interaction with a single DNA molecule in real-time,\noffering a unique way to detect potential alternative DNA structures.\nRESULTS: We have developed a new way to examine polymerase kinetics data and\nrelate it to the DNA sequence by using a wavelet transform of read information\nfrom the sequencer. We use this method to examine how polymerase kinetics are\nrelated to nucleotide base composition. We then examine tandem repeat sequences\nknown for their ability to form different DNA structures: (CGG)n and (CG)n\nrepeats which can, respectively, form G-quadruplex DNA and Z-DNA. We find pausing\naround the (CGG)n repeat that may indicate the presence of G-quadruplexes in some\nof the sequencer reads. The (CG)n repeat does not appear to cause polymerase\npausing, but its kinetics signature nevertheless suggests the possibility that\nalternative nucleotide conformations may sometimes be present.\nCONCLUSION: We discuss the implications of using our method to discover DNA\nsequences capable of forming alternative structures.

Most seeding algorithms are based on backward\nsearch alignment, using the Burrows Wheeler Transform, the Ferragina and Manzini \nIndex or Suffix Arrays. All these backward search algorithms have excellent\nperformance, but their computational cost highly increases when allowing errors. \nIn this paper, we discuss an inexact mapping algorithm based on pruning\nstrategies for search tree exploration over genomic data.\nRESULTS: The proposed algorithm achieves a 13x speed-up over similar algorithms\nwhen allowing 6 base errors, including insertions, deletions and mismatches. This\nalgorithm can deal with 400 bps reads with up to 9 errors in a high quality\nIllumina dataset. In this example, the algorithm works as a preprocessor that\nreduces by 55% the number of reads to be aligned. Depending on the aligner the\noverall execution time is reduced between 20-40%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although not intended as a complete sequence mapping tool, the\nproposed algorithm could be used as a preprocessing step to modern sequence\nmappers. This step significantly reduces the number reads to be aligned,\naccelerating overall alignment time. Furthermore, this algorithm could be used\nfor accelerating the seeding step of already available sequence mappers. In\naddition, an out-of-core index has been implemented for working with large\ngenomes on systems without expensive memory configurations.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0438-3 \nPMCID: PMC4384339\nPMID: 25626517  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The traditional eQTL methods focus on testing the associations\nbetween individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene expression\ntraits. A major drawback of this approach is that it cannot model the joint\neffect of a set of SNPs on a set of genes, which may correspond to hidden\nbiological pathways.\nRESULTS: We introduce a new approach to identify novel group-wise associations\nbetween sets of SNPs and sets of genes. Such associations are captured by hidden \nvariables connecting SNPs and genes. Our model is a linear-Gaussian model and\nuses two types of hidden variables. One captures the set associations between\nSNPs and genes, and the other captures confounders. We develop an efficient\noptimization procedure which makes this approach suitable for large scale\nstudies. Extensive experimental evaluations on both simulated and real datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively capture both individual and\ngroup-wise signals that cannot be identified by the state-of-the-art eQTL mapping\nmethods.\nCONCLUSIONS: Considering group-wise associations significantly improves the\naccuracy of eQTL mapping, and the successful multi-layer regression model opens a\nnew approach to understand how multiple SNPs interact with each other to jointly \naffect the expression level of a group of genes.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0421-z \nPMCID: PMC4387667\nPMID: 25593000  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

New, computationally efficient\nmethods are needed for ancestry inference that can effectively utilize existing\ninformation about allele frequencies associated with different human populations \nand can work directly with DNA sequence reads.\nRESULTS: We describe a fast method for estimating the relative contribution of\nknown reference populations to an individual's genetic ancestry. Our method\nutilizes allele frequencies from the reference populations and individual\ngenotype or sequence data to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of the global\nadmixture proportions using the BFGS optimization algorithm. It accounts for the \nuncertainty in genotypes present in sequence data by using genotype likelihoods\nand does not require individual genotype data from external reference panels.\nSimulation studies and application of the method to real datasets demonstrate\nthat our method is significantly times faster than previous methods and has\ncomparable accuracy. Using data from the 1000 Genomes project, we show that\nestimates of the genome-wide average ancestry for admixed individuals are\nconsistent between exome sequence data and whole-genome low-coverage sequence\ndata. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be used to estimate admixture\nproportions using pooled sequence data making it a valuable tool for controlling \nfor population stratification in sequencing based association studies that\nutilize DNA pooling.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our method is an efficient and versatile tool for estimating\nancestry from DNA sequence data and is available from\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/vibansal/software/iAdmix .\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0418-7 \nPMCID: PMC4301802\nPMID: 25592880  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, little is known about how expression of parental\ngene copies (homeologs) responds following genome merger. High throughput RNA\nsequencing now makes this analysis technically feasible, but tools to determine\nhomeolog expression are still in their infancy.\nRESULTS: Here we present HyLiTE - a single-step analysis to obtain tables of\nhomeolog expression in a hybrid or allopolyploid and its parent species directly \nfrom raw mRNA sequence files. By implementing on-the-fly detection of diagnostic \nparental polymorphisms, HyLiTE can perform SNP calling and read classification\nsimultaneously, thus allowing HyLiTE to be run as parallelized code. HyLiTE\naccommodates any number of parent species, multiple data sources (including\ngenomic DNA reads to improve SNP detection), and implements a statistical\nframework optimized for genes with low to moderate expression.\nCONCLUSIONS: HyLiTE is a flexible and easy-to-use program designed for bench\nbiologists to explore patterns of gene expression following genome merger. HyLiTE\noffers practical advantages over manual methods and existing programs, has been\ndesigned to accommodate a wide range of genome merger systems, can identify SNPs \nthat arose following genome merger, and offers accurate performance on non-model \norganisms.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0433-8 \nPMCID: PMC4300824\nPMID: 25592117  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

While CNVs are often only common in a\nsmall number of samples in the studied population or patient cohort, previous\nwork has not focused on customized identification of CNV regions that only\nexhibit in subsets of samples with advanced data mining techniques to reliably\nanswer questions such as \"Which are all the chromosomal fragments showing nearly \nidentical deletions or insertions in more than 30% of the individuals?\".\nRESULTS: We introduce a tool for mining CNV subspace patterns, namely SubPatCNV, \nwhich is capable of identifying all aberrant CNV regions specific to arbitrary\nsample subsets larger than a support threshold. By design, SubPatCNV is the\nimplementation of a variation of approximate association pattern mining algorithm\nunder a spatial constraint on the positional CNV probe features. In benchmark\ntest, SubPatCNV was applied to identify population specific germline CNVs from\nfour populations of HapMap samples. In experiments on the TCGA ovarian cancer\ndataset, SubPatCNV discovered many large aberrant CNV events in patient\nsubgroups, and reported regions enriched with cancer relevant genes. In both\nHapMap data and TCGA data, it was observed that SubPatCNV employs approximate\npattern mining to more effectively identify CNV subspace patterns that are\nconsistent within a subgroup from high-density array data.\nCONCLUSIONS: SubPatCNV available through\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/subpatcnv/ is a unique scalable open-source\nsoftware tool that provides the flexibility of identifying CNV regions specific\nto sample subgroups of different sizes from high-density CNV array data.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0426-7 \nPMCID: PMC4305219\nPMID: 25591662  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The core algorithm of the\nexistent approach ExpaRNA solves this problem for a priori known input\nstructures. However, such structures are rarely known; moreover, predicting them \ncomputationally is no rescue, since single sequence structure prediction is\nhighly unreliable.\nRESULTS: The novel algorithm ExpaRNA-P computes exactly matching\nsequence-structure motifs in entire Boltzmann-distributed structure ensembles of \ntwo RNAs; thereby we match and fold RNAs simultaneously, analogous to the\nwell-known \"simultaneous alignment and folding\" of RNAs. While this implies much \nhigher flexibility compared to ExpaRNA, ExpaRNA-P has the same very low\ncomplexity (quadratic in time and space), which is enabled by its novel structure\nensemble-based sparsification. Furthermore, we devise a generalized chaining\nalgorithm to compute compatible subsets of ExpaRNA-P's sequence-structure motifs.\nResulting in the very fast RNA alignment approach ExpLoc-P, we utilize the best\nchain as anchor constraints for the sequence-structure alignment tool LocARNA.\nExpLoc-P is benchmarked in several variants and versus state-of-the-art\napproaches. In particular, we formally introduce and evaluate strict and relaxed \nvariants of the problem; the latter makes the approach sensitive to compensatory \nmutations. Across a benchmark set of typical non-coding RNAs, ExpLoc-P has\nsimilar accuracy to LocARNA but is four times faster (in both variants), while it\nachieves a speed-up over 30-fold for the longest benchmark sequences (≈400nt).\nFinally, different ExpLoc-P variants enable tailoring of the method to specific\napplication scenarios. ExpaRNA-P and ExpLoc-P are distributed as part of the\nLocARNA package. The source code is freely available at\nhttp://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/ExpaRNA-P .\nCONCLUSIONS: ExpaRNA-P's novel ensemble-based sparsification reduces its\ncomplexity to quadratic time and space. Thereby, ExpaRNA-P significantly speeds\nup sequence-structure alignment while maintaining the alignment quality.\nDifferent ExpaRNA-P variants support a wide range of applications.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0404-0 \nPMCID: PMC4302096\nPMID: 25551362  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A\ntypical control strategy starts by analyzing a sample for the presence of target \nsequences (GM-elements) known to be present in many GMOs. Positive findings from \nthis \"screening\" are then confirmed with GM (event) specific test methods. A\nreliable knowledge of which GMOs are detected by combinations of GM-detection\nmethods is thus crucial to minimize the verification efforts.\nDESCRIPTION: In this article, we describe a novel platform that links the\ninformation of two unique databases built and maintained by the European Union\nReference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed (EU-RL GMFF) at the\nJoint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, one containing the\nsequence information of known GM-events and the other validated PCR-based\ndetection and identification methods. The new platform compiles in silico\ndeterminations of the detection of a wide range of GMOs by the available\ndetection methods using existing scripts that simulate PCR amplification and,\nwhen present, probe binding. The correctness of the information has been verified\nby comparing the in silico conclusions to experimental results for a subset of\nforty-nine GM events and six methods.\nCONCLUSIONS: The JRC GMO-Matrix is unique for its reliance on DNA sequence data\nand its flexibility in integrating novel GMOs and new detection methods. Users\ncan mine the database using a set of web interfaces that thus provide a valuable \nsupport to GMO control laboratories in planning and evaluating their GMO\nscreening strategies.

These molecules silence their target genes by\ndegrading transcription or suppressing translation. Studies have shown that\nmiRNAs are involved in biological responses to a variety of biotic and abiotic\nstresses. Identification of these molecules and their targets can aid the\nunderstanding of regulatory processes. Recently, prediction methods based on\nmachine learning have been widely used for miRNA prediction. However, most of\nthese methods were designed for mammalian miRNA prediction, and few are available\nfor predicting miRNAs in the pre-miRNAs of specific plant species. Although the\ncomplete Solanum lycopersicum genome has been published, only 77 Solanum\nlycopersicum miRNAs have been identified, far less than the estimated number.\nTherefore, it is essential to develop a prediction method based on machine\nlearning to identify new plant miRNAs.\nRESULTS: A novel classification model based on a support vector machine (SVM) was\ntrained to identify real and pseudo plant pre-miRNAs together with their miRNAs. \nAn initial set of 152 novel features related to sequential structures was used to\ntrain the model. By applying feature selection, we obtained the best subset of 47\nfeatures for use with the Back Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature\nElimination (B-SVM-RFE) method for the classification of plant pre-miRNAs. Using \nthis method, 63 features were obtained for plant miRNA classification. We then\ndeveloped an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat, which comprises\nMiPlantPre and MiPlantMat, to identify plant pre-miRNAs and their miRNAs. This\nmodel achieved approximately 90% accuracy using plant datasets from nine plant\nspecies, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, Oryza sativa,\nPhyscomitrella patens, Medicago truncatula, Sorghum bicolor, Arabidopsis lyrata, \nZea mays and Solanum lycopersicum. Using miPlantPreMat, 522 Solanum lycopersicum \nmiRNAs were identified in the Solanum lycopersicum genome sequence.\nCONCLUSIONS: We developed an integrated classification model, miPlantPreMat,\nbased on structure-sequence features and SVM. MiPlantPreMat was used to identify \nboth plant pre-miRNAs and the corresponding mature miRNAs. An improved feature\nselection method was proposed, resulting in high classification accuracy,\nsensitivity and specificity.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0423-x \nPMCID: PMC4310204\nPMID: 25547126  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, as\ninteroperability pains in EHR/EMR, HIE and other collaboration-centric life\nsciences domains have taught us, the core challenge of networking genomics\nsystems is not in the construction of individual silos, but the interoperability \nof those deployments in a manner embracing the heterogeneous needs, terms and\ninfrastructure of collaborating parties.

Epub\n2014 Dec 8.\n\nSCMHBP: prediction and analysis of heme binding proteins using propensity scores \nof dipeptides.\n\nLiou YF, Charoenkwan P, Srinivasulu Y, Vasylenko T, Lai SC, Lee HC, Chen YH,\nHuang HL, Ho SY.\n\nBACKGROUND: Heme binding proteins (HBPs) are metalloproteins that contain a heme \nligand (an iron-porphyrin complex) as the prosthetic group. Several computational\nmethods have been proposed to predict heme binding residues and thereby to\nunderstand the interactions between heme and its host proteins. However, few in\nsilico methods for identifying HBPs have been proposed.\nRESULTS: This work proposes a scoring card method (SCM) based method (named\nSCMHBP) for predicting and analyzing HBPs from sequences. A balanced dataset of\n747 HBPs (selected using a Gene Ontology term GO:0020037) and 747 non-HBPs\n(selected from 91,414 putative non-HBPs) with an identity of 25% was firstly\nestablished. Consequently, a set of scores that quantified the propensity of\namino acids and dipeptides to be HBPs is estimated using SCM to maximize the\npredictive accuracy of SCMHBP. Finally, the informative physicochemical\nproperties of 20 amino acids are identified by utilizing the estimated propensity\nscores to be used to categorize HBPs. The training and mean test accuracies of\nSCMHBP applied to three independent test datasets are 85.90% and 71.57%,\nrespectively. SCMHBP performs well relative to comparison with such methods as\nsupport vector machine (SVM), decision tree J48, and Bayes classifiers. The\nputative non-HBPs with high sequence propensity scores are potential HBPs, which \ncan be further validated by experimental confirmation. The propensity scores of\nindividual amino acids and dipeptides are examined to elucidate the interactions \nbetween heme and its host proteins. The following characteristics of HBPs are\nderived from the propensity scores: 1) aromatic side chains are important to the \neffectiveness of specific HBP functions; 2) a hydrophobic environment is\nimportant in the interaction between heme and binding sites; and 3) the whole HBP\nhas low flexibility whereas the heme binding residues are relatively flexible.\nCONCLUSIONS: SCMHBP yields knowledge that improves our understanding of HBPs\nrather than merely improves the prediction accuracy in predicting HBPs.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S4 \nPMCID: PMC4290654\nPMID: 25522279  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epub\n2014 Dec 8.\n\nIntroducing TreeCollapse: a novel greedy algorithm to solve the cophylogeny\nreconstruction problem.\n\nDrinkwater B, Charleston MA.\n\nBACKGROUND: Cophylogeny mapping is used to uncover deep coevolutionary\nassociations between two or more phylogenetic histories at a macro coevolutionary\nscale. As cophylogeny mapping is NP-Hard, this technique relies heavily on\nheuristics to solve all but the most trivial cases. One notable approach utilises\na metaheuristic to search only a subset of the exponential number of fixed node\norderings possible for the phylogenetic histories in question. This is of\nparticular interest as it is the only known heuristic that guarantees\nbiologically feasible solutions. This has enabled research to focus on larger\ncoevolutionary systems, such as coevolutionary associations between figs and\ntheir pollinator wasps, including over 200 taxa. Although able to converge on\nsolutions for problem instances of this size, a reduction from the current cubic \nrunning time is required to handle larger systems, such as Wolbachia and their\ninsect hosts.\nRESULTS: Rather than solving this underlying problem optimally this work presents\na greedy algorithm called TreeCollapse, which uses common topological patterns to\nrecover an approximation of the coevolutionary history where the internal node\nordering is fixed. This approach offers a significant speed-up compared to\nprevious methods, running in linear time. This algorithm has been applied to over\n100 well-known coevolutionary systems converging on Pareto optimal solutions in\nover 68% of test cases, even where in some cases the Pareto optimal solution has \nnot previously been recoverable. Further, while TreeCollapse applies a local\nsearch technique, it can guarantee solutions are biologically feasible, making\nthis the fastest method that can provide such a guarantee.\nCONCLUSION: As a result, we argue that the newly proposed algorithm is a valuable\naddition to the field of coevolutionary research. Not only does it offer a\nsignificantly faster method to estimate the cost of cophylogeny mappings but by\nusing this approach, in conjunction with existing heuristics, it can assist in\nrecovering a larger subset of the Pareto front than has previously been possible.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S14 \nPMCID: PMC4290644\nPMID: 25521705  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Use of plasma-treated graphene enables better control of\nprotein distribution in ice for electron cryo-microscopy and improves image\nquality by reducing radiation-induced sample motion.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2931 \nPMCID: PMC4141966\nPMID: 24747813  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We exploited tunable expression via RNAi and a\ndynamically exchanging monomer pool to achieve fast, continuous single-molecule\nimaging at optimal densities with signal-to-noise ratios adequate for robust\nsingle-particle tracking (SPT). We introduce a method called smPReSS,\nsingle-molecule photobleaching relaxation to steady state, that infers exchange\nrates from quantitative analysis of single-molecule photobleaching kinetics\nwithout using SPT. Combining SPT and smPReSS allowed for spatially and temporally\nresolved measurements of protein mobility and exchange kinetics. We used these\nmethods to (i) resolve distinct mobility states and spatial variation in exchange\nrates of the polarity protein PAR-6 and (ii) measure spatiotemporal modulation of\nactin filament assembly and disassembly. These methods offer a promising avenue\nto investigate dynamic mechanisms that pattern the embryonic cell surface.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2928 \nPMCID: PMC4046709\nPMID: 24727651  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Imaging of fluorescent proteins (FPs) using \nred excitation light in the 'optical window' above 600 nm is one potential method\nfor visualizing implanted cells. However, previous efforts to engineer FPs with\npeak excitation beyond 600 nm have resulted in undesirable reductions in\nbrightness. Here we report three new red-excitable monomeric FPs obtained by\nstructure-guided mutagenesis of mNeptune. Two of these, mNeptune2 and\nmNeptune2.5, demonstrate improved maturation and brighter fluorescence than\nmNeptune, whereas the third, mCardinal, has a red-shifted excitation spectrum\nwithout reduction in brightness. We show that mCardinal can be used to\nnon-invasively and longitudinally visualize the differentiation of myoblasts into\nmyocytes in living mice with high anatomical detail.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2888 \nPMCID: PMC4008650\nPMID: 24633408  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We designed precomputed light sequences based on\nexperimentally calibrated mathematical models of light-switchable two-component\nsystems and used them to drive intracellular protein levels to match user-defined\nreference time courses. We used this approach to generate accelerated and\nlinearized dynamics, sinusoidal oscillations with desired amplitudes and periods,\nand a complex waveform, all with unprecedented accuracy and precision. We also\ncombined the function generator with a dual fluorescent protein reporter system, \nanalogous to a dual-channel oscilloscope, to reveal that a synthetic repressible \npromoter linearly transforms repressor signals with an approximate 7-min delay.\nOur approach will enable a new generation of dynamical analyses of synthetic and \nnatural gene circuits, providing an essential step toward the predictive design\nand rigorous understanding of biological systems.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2884 \nPMID: 24608181  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

For cellular studies, the\nconventional imaging modality of transmission electron microscopy places\nstringent constraints on sample thickness because of its dependence on phase\ncoherence for contrast generation. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using\nscanning transmission electron microscopy for cryo-tomography of unstained\nvitrified specimens (CSTET). We compare CSTET and CET for the imaging of whole\nbacteria and human tissue culture cells, finding favorable contrast and detail in\nthe CSTET reconstructions. Particularly at high sample tilts, the CSTET signals\ncontain more informative data than energy-filtered CET phase contrast images,\nresulting in improved depth resolution. Careful control over dose delivery\npermits relatively high cumulative exposures before the onset of observable beam \ndamage. The increase in acceptable specimen thickness broadens the applicability \nof electron cryo-tomography.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2842 \nPMID: 24531421  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A long-standing question is whether it is possible to\nindependently activate two distinct neural populations in mammalian brain tissue.\nSuch a capability would enable the study of how different synapses or pathways\ninteract to encode information in the brain. Here we describe two\nchannelrhodopsins, Chronos and Chrimson, discovered through sequencing and\nphysiological characterization of opsins from over 100 species of alga.\nChrimson's excitation spectrum is red shifted by 45 nm relative to previous\nchannelrhodopsins and can enable experiments in which red light is preferred. We \nshow minimal visual system-mediated behavioral interference when using Chrimson\nin neurobehavioral studies in Drosophila melanogaster. Chronos has faster\nkinetics than previous channelrhodopsins yet is effectively more light sensitive.\nTogether these two reagents enable two-color activation of neural spiking and\ndownstream synaptic transmission in independent neural populations without\ndetectable cross-talk in mouse brain slice.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2836 \nPMCID: PMC3943671\nPMID: 24509633  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Because manually\ndetecting and following large numbers of individual particles is not feasible,\nautomated computational methods have been developed for these tasks by many\ngroups. Aiming to perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the\ncommunity and organized an open competition in which participating teams applied \ntheir own methods independently to a commonly defined data set including diverse \nscenarios. Performance was assessed using commonly defined measures. Although no \nsingle method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear\ndifferences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical\nconclusions for users and developers.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2808 \nPMCID: PMC4131736\nPMID: 24441936  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Among these probes, fluorescent proteins are\nappealing because they are genetically encoded. Moreover, the ability to achieve \na 1:1 labeling ratio between the fluorescent protein and the protein of interest \nmakes these probes attractive for quantitative single-molecule counting. The\npercentage of fluorescent protein that is photoactivated into a fluorescently\ndetectable form (i.e., the photoactivation efficiency) plays a crucial part in\nproperly interpreting the quantitative information. It is important to\ncharacterize the photoactivation efficiency at the single-molecule level under\nthe conditions used in super-resolution imaging. Here, we used the human glycine \nreceptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes and stepwise photobleaching or\nsingle-molecule counting photoactivated localization microcopy (PALM) to\ndetermine the photoactivation efficiency of fluorescent proteins mEos2, mEos3.1, \nmEos3.2, Dendra2, mClavGR2, mMaple, PA-GFP and PA-mCherry.

Here we show\nthat two small molecules, CHIR99021 and valproic acid, synergistically maintain\nself-renewal of mouse Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells, resulting in nearly\nhomogeneous cultures. The colony-forming efficiency of cells from these cultures \nis ~100-fold greater than that of cells cultured in the absence of CHIR99021 and \nvalproic acid, and multilineage differentiation ability is preserved. We made use\nof these homogeneous cultures to identify conditions employing simultaneous\nmodulation of Wnt and Notch signaling to direct lineage differentiation into\nmature enterocytes, goblet cells and Paneth cells. Expansion in these culture\nconditions may be feasible for Lgr5(+) cells from the mouse stomach and colon and\nfrom the human small intestine. These methods provide new tools for the study and\napplication of multiple intestinal epithelial cell types.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2737 \nPMCID: PMC3951815\nPMID: 24292484  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

There is currently no complete chemically defined (holidic) diet\navailable for Drosophila melanogaster. We describe a holidic medium that is equal\nin performance to an oligidic diet optimized for adult fecundity and lifespan.\nThis holidic diet supports development over multiple generations but at a reduced\nrate. Over 7 years of experiments, the holidic diet yielded more consistent\nexperimental outcomes than did oligidic food for egg laying by females. Nutrients\nand drugs were more available to flies in holidic medium and, similar to dietary \nrestriction on oligidic food, amino acid dilution increased fly lifespan. We used\nthis holidic medium to investigate amino acid-specific effects on food-choice\nbehavior and report that folic acid from the microbiota is sufficient for\nDrosophila development.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2731 \nPMCID: PMC3877687\nPMID: 24240321  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Nevertheless, it has been challenging to directly monitor changes in\ntranslation in living cells. We have developed a reporter system to measure\nreal-time changes of translation rates in human or mouse individual cells by\nconjugating translation regulatory motifs to sequences encoding a nuclear\ntargeted fluorescent protein and a controllable destabilization domain.\nApplication of the method showed that individual cells undergo marked\nfluctuations in the translation rate of mRNAs whose 5' terminal oligopyrimidine\n(5' TOP) motif regulates the synthesis of ribosomal proteins. Furthermore, we\nshow that small reductions in amino acid levels signal through different\nmTOR-dependent pathways to control TOP mRNA translation, whereas larger\nreductions in amino acid levels control translation through eIF2A. Our study\ndemonstrates that dynamic measurements of single-cell activities of translation\nregulatory motifs can be used to identify and investigate fundamental principles \nof translation.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2729 \nPMCID: PMC4039304\nPMID: 24213167  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Complexes supporting transient functions such as\nsignal transduction processes are frequently subject to dynamic remodeling.\nCurrently, the majority of studies on the composition of protein complexes are\ncarried out by affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and present a \nstatic view of the system. For a better understanding of inherently dynamic\nbiological processes, methods to reliably quantify temporal changes of protein\ninteraction networks are essential. Here we used affinity purification combined\nwith sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra (AP-SWATH) mass\nspectrometry to study the dynamics of the 14-3-3β scaffold protein interactome\nafter stimulation of the insulin-PI3K-AKT pathway. The consistent and\nreproducible quantification of 1,967 proteins across all stimulation time points \nprovided insights into the 14-3-3β interactome and its dynamic changes following \nIGF1 stimulation. We therefore establish AP-SWATH as a tool to quantify dynamic\nchanges in protein-complex interaction networks.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2703 \nPMID: 24162925  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epigenome-wide\nscreening methods cover an increasing number of CpG sites, but the complexity of \nthe data poses a challenge to separating robust signals from noise.

The ability to precisely modify genomes is\ncritical to fully realize the utility of model organisms. Here we report a method\nto edit the C. elegans genome using the clustered, regularly interspersed, short \npalindromic repeats (CRISPR) RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease and homologous\nrecombination. We demonstrate that Cas9 is able to induce DNA double-strand\nbreaks with specificity for targeted sites and that these breaks can be repaired \nefficiently by homologous recombination. By supplying engineered homologous\nrepair templates, we generated gfp knock-ins and targeted mutations. Together our\nresults outline a flexible methodology to produce essentially any desired\nmodification in the C. elegans genome quickly and at low cost. This technology is\nan important addition to the array of genetic techniques already available in\nthis experimentally tractable model organism.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2641 \nPMCID: PMC3905680\nPMID: 23995389  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Tools have been released to\nextract FASTA/Q from the MinION base calling output and to provide basic yield\nstatistics. However, no single tool yet exists to provide comprehensive\nalignment-based quality control and error profile analysis--something that is\nextremely important given the speed with which the platform is evolving.\nRESULTS: NanoOK generates detailed tabular and graphical output plus an in-depth \nmulti-page PDF report including error profile, quality and yield data. NanoOK is \nmulti-reference, enabling detailed analysis of metagenomic or multiplexed\nsamples. Four popular Nanopore aligners are supported and it is easily extensible\nto include others.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NanoOK is an open-source software, implemented\nin Java with supporting R scripts. It has been tested on Linux and Mac OS X and\ncan be downloaded from https://github.com/TGAC/NanoOK. A VirtualBox VM containing\nall dependencies and the DH10B read set used in this article is available from\nhttp://opendata.tgac.ac.uk/nanook/.

While models\nwith constrained substitution rate matrices have been used to good effect, more\nbiologically realistic models have been increasingly implemented in the recent\nliterature combining, e.g., site rate variation, site partitioning,\nbranch-specific rates, allowing for non-stationary prior root probabilities,\ncorrecting for sampling bias, etc. to name a few. Here, a flexible and fast R\npackage is introduced that infers evolutionary rates of discrete characters on a \ntree within a probabilistic framework. The package, markophylo, fits\nmaximum-likelihood models using Markov chains on phylogenetic trees. The package \nis efficient, with the workhorse functions written in C++ and the interface in\nuser-friendly R.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: markophylo is available as a\nplatform-independent R package from the Comprehensive R Archive Network at\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/markophylo/.

Because the raw sequences are\nredundant once the alignment has been generated, it is possible to keep only the \nalignment files. We present BamHash, a checksum based method to ensure that the\nread pairs in FASTQ files match exactly the read pairs stored in BAM files,\nregardless of the ordering of reads. BamHash can be used to verify the integrity \nof the files stored and discover any discrepancies. Thus, BamHash can be used to \ndetermine if it is safe to delete the FASTQ files storing raw sequencing read\nafter alignment, without the loss of data.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is implemented in C++, GPL licensed\nand available at https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/BamHash\nCONTACT: pmelsted@hi.is.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Identification and analysis\nof intramolecular motions is a complex problem. Breaking a structure into\nrelatively rigid parts, the so-called dynamic domains, may help comprehend the\ncomplexity of protein's mobility. We propose a new approach called ResiCon\n(Residue Contacts analysis), which performs this task by applying a data-mining\nanalysis of an ensemble of protein configurations and recognizes dynamic domains,\nhinges and interfacial regions, by considering contacts between residues.\nRESULTS: Dynamic domains found by ResiCon are more compact than those identified \nby two other popular methods: PiSQRD and GeoStaS. The current analysis was\ncarried out using a known reference set of 30 NMR protein structures, as well as \nmolecular dynamics simulation data of flap opening events in HIV-1 protease. The \nmore detailed analysis of HIV-1 protease dataset shows that ResiCon identified\ndynamic domains involved in structural changes of functional importance.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The ResiCon server is available at URL:\nhttp://dworkowa.imdik.pan.pl/EP/ResiCon.\nCONTACT: pawel@bioexploratorium.pl\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Thanks\nto comparative metatranscriptomics, the cellular functions that are deregulated\nby the microbiome in disease can now be computationally explored. Unlike\ngene-centric approaches, pathway-based methods provide a systemic view of such\nfunctions; however, they typically consider each pathway in isolation and in its \nentirety. They can therefore overlook the key differences that (i) span multiple \npathways, (ii) contain bidirectionally deregulated components, (iii) are confined\nto a pathway region. To capture these properties, computational methods that\nreach beyond the scope of predefined pathways are needed.\nRESULTS: By integrating an existing module discovery algorithm into comparative\nmetatranscriptomic analysis, we developed metaModules, a novel computational\nframework for automated identification of the key functional differences between \nhealth- and disease-associated communities. Using this framework, we recovered\nsignificantly deregulated subnetworks that were indeed recognized to be involved \nin two well-studied, microbiome-mediated oral diseases, such as butanoate\nproduction in periodontal disease and metabolism of sugar alcohols in dental\ncaries. More importantly, our results indicate that our method can be used for\nhypothesis generation based on automated discovery of novel, disease-related\nfunctional subnetworks, which would otherwise require extensive and laborious\nmanual assessment.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: metaModules is available at\nhttps://bitbucket.org/alimay/metamodules/\nCONTACT: a.may@vu.nl or s.abeln@vu.nl\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

In this\narticle, this vast amount of information is used to develop a novel model for\nhospital admission type prediction.\nRESULTS: I introduce a novel model for hospital admission-type prediction based\non the representation of a patient's medical history in the form of a binary\nhistory vector. This representation is motivated using empirical evidence from\nprevious work and validated using a large data corpus of medical records from a\nlocal hospital. The proposed model allows exploration, visualization and\npatient-specific prognosis making in an intuitive and readily understood manner. \nIts power is demonstrated using a large, real-world data corpus collected by a\nlocal hospital on which it is shown to outperform previous state-of-the-art in\nthe literature, achieving over 82% accuracy in the prediction of the first future\ndiagnosis. The model was vastly superior for long-term prognosis as well,\noutperforming previous work in 82% of the cases, while producing comparable\nperformance in the remaining 18% of the cases.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Full Matlab source code is freely available for \ndownload at: http://ognjen-arandjelovic.t15.org/data/dprog.zip.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Such networks are often obtained by considering pairwise\ncorrelations between genes, thus may not reflect the true connectivity between\ngenes. By treating gene expressions as quantitative traits while considering\ngenetic markers, genetical genomics analysis has shown its power in enhancing the\nunderstanding of gene regulations. Previous works have shown the improved\nperformance on estimating the undirected network graphical structure by\nincorporating genetic markers as covariates. Knowing that gene expressions are\noften due to directed regulations, it is more meaningful to estimate the directed\ngraphical network.\nRESULTS: In this article, we introduce a covariate-adjusted Gaussian graphical\nmodel to estimate the Markov equivalence class of the directed acyclic graphs\n(DAGs) in a genetical genomics analysis framework. We develop a two-stage\nestimation procedure to first estimate the regression coefficient matrix by\n[Formula: see text] penalization. The estimated coefficient matrix is then used\nto estimate the mean values in our multi-response Gaussian model to estimate the \nregulatory networks of gene expressions using PC-algorithm. The estimation\nconsistency for high dimensional sparse DAGs is established. Simulations are\nconducted to demonstrate our theoretical results. The method is applied to a\nhuman Alzheimer's disease dataset in which differential DAGs are identified\nbetween cases and controls.

Haplotype assembly highly benefits from the advent of\n'future-generation' sequencing technologies and their capability to produce long \nreads at increasing coverage. Existing methods are not able to deal with such\ndata in a fully satisfactory way, either because accuracy or performances degrade\nas read length and sequencing coverage increase or because they are based on\nrestrictive assumptions.\nRESULTS: By exploiting a feature of future-generation technologies-the uniform\ndistribution of sequencing errors-we designed an exact algorithm, called HapCol, \nthat is exponential in the maximum number of corrections for each\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphism position and that minimizes the overall\nerror-correction score. We performed an experimental analysis, comparing HapCol\nwith the current state-of-the-art combinatorial methods both on real and\nsimulated data. On a standard benchmark of real data, we show that HapCol is\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art methods, improving the accuracy and the number \nof phased positions. Furthermore, experiments on realistically simulated datasets\nrevealed that HapCol requires significantly less computing resources, especially \nmemory. Thanks to its computational efficiency, HapCol can overcome the limits of\nprevious approaches, allowing to phase datasets with higher coverage and without \nthe traditional all-heterozygous assumption.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our source code is available under the terms of \nthe GNU General Public License at http://hapcol.algolab.eu/\nCONTACT: bonizzoni@disco.unimib.it\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

However, there is little consistency among\nthe regions detected in several genome-wide scans using different tests and/or\npopulations. Furthermore, few methods address the challenge of classifying\nselective events according to specific features such as age, intensity or state\n(completeness).\nRESULTS: We have developed a machine-learning classification framework that\nexploits the combined ability of some selection tests to uncover different\npolymorphism features expected under the hard sweep model, while controlling for \npopulation-specific demography. As a result, we achieve high sensitivity toward\nhard selective sweeps while adding insights about their completeness (whether a\nselected variant is fixed or not) and age of onset. Our method also determines\nthe relevance of the individual methods implemented so far to detect positive\nselection under specific selective scenarios. We calibrated and applied the\nmethod to three reference human populations from The 1000 Genome Project to\ngenerate a genome-wide classification map of hard selective sweeps. This study\nimproves detection of selective sweep by overcoming the classical selection\nversus no-selection classification strategy, and offers an explanation to the\nlack of consistency observed among selection tests when applied to real data.\nVery few signals were observed in the African population studied, while our\nmethod presents higher sensitivity in this population demography.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The genome-wide results for three human\npopulations from The 1000 Genomes Project and an R-package implementing the\n'Hierarchical Boosting' framework are available at http://hsb.upf.edu/.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Recently, technologies such as Hi-C that combine proximity ligation\nwith high-throughput sequencing have revealed domains of self-interacting\nchromatin, called topologically associating domains (TADs), in many organisms.\nCurrent methods for identifying TADs using Hi-C data assume that TADs are\nnon-overlapping, despite evidence for a nested structure in which TADs and\nsub-TADs form a complex hierarchy.\nRESULTS: We introduce a model for decomposition of contact frequencies into a\nhierarchy of nested TADs. This model is based on empirical distributions of\ncontact frequencies within TADs, where positions that are far apart have a\ngreater enrichment of contacts than positions that are close together. We find\nthat the increase in contact enrichment with distance is stronger for the inner\nTAD than for the outer TAD in a TAD/sub-TAD pair. Using this model, we develop\nthe TADtree algorithm for detecting hierarchies of nested TADs. TADtree compares \nfavorably with previous methods, finding TADs with a greater enrichment of\nchromatin marks such as CTCF at their boundaries.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A python implementation of TADtree is available \nat http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/software/\nCONTACT: braphael@cs.brown.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

We have\nimplemented aRrayLasso in a set of five open-source R functions that allow the\nuser to acquire data from public sources such as Gene Expression Omnibus, train a\nset of Lasso models on that data and directly map one microarray platform to\nanother. aRrayLasso significantly predicts expression levels with similar\nfidelity to technical replicates of the same RNA pool, demonstrating its utility \nin the integration of datasets from different platforms.AVAILABILITY AND\nIMPLEMENTATION: All functions are available, along with descriptions, at\nhttps://github.com/adam-sam-brown/aRrayLasso.\nCONTACT: chirag_patel@hms.harvard.edu.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Since dysfunctional\nregulation would be manifested as the decoupling of expression correlation,\ndisease similarity (DS) in terms of dysfunctional regulation mechanism (DRM)\ncould be estimated by using a differential coexpression based approach, which is \ndescribed in a companion paper. Due to the lack of tools for estimating DS from\nthe viewpoint of DRM in public domain, we implemented an R package 'DSviaDRM' to \nidentify significant DS via DRM based on transcriptomic data. DSviaDRM contains\nfive easy-to-use functions, DCEA, DCpathway, DS, comDCGL and comDCGLplot, for\nidentifying disease relationships and showing common differential regulation\ninformation shared by similar diseases.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DSviaDRM \nis available as an R package, with a user's guide and source code, at\nhttp://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DSviaDRM/index.html.\nCONTACT: yyli@scbit.org or yxli@scbit.org.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

While\nexisting informatics tools provide efficient bulk variant annotations, they often\ngenerate excess information that may limit their scalability.\nRESULTS: We propose an alternative solution based on description logic\ninferencing to generate workflows that produce only those annotations that will\ncontribute to the interpretation of each variant. Workflows are dynamically\ngenerated using a novel abductive reasoning framework called a basic framework\nfor abductive workflow generation (AbFab). Criteria for identifying\ndisease-causing variants in Mendelian blood disorders were identified and\nimplemented as AbFab services. A web application was built allowing users to run \nworkflows generated from the criteria to analyze genomic variants. Significant\nvariants are flagged and explanations provided for why they match or fail to\nmatch the criteria.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Mutadelic web application is available for\nuse at http://krauthammerlab.med.yale.edu/mutadelic.\nCONTACT: michael.krauthammer@yale.edu.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

OVA combines a knowledge-based approach with a\nvariant-filtering framework. It reduces the number of candidate variants by\nconsidering genotype and predicted effect on protein sequence, and scores the\nremainder on biological relevance to the query phenotype.We take advantage of\nseveral ontologies in order to bridge knowledge across multiple biomedical\ndomains and facilitate computational analysis of annotations pertaining to genes,\ndiseases, phenotypes, tissues and pathways. In this way, OVA combines information\nregarding molecular and physical phenotypes and integrates both human and model\norganism data to effectively prioritize variants. By assessing performance on\nboth known and novel disease mutations, we show that OVA performs biologically\nmeaningful candidate variant prioritization and can be more accurate than another\nrecently published candidate variant prioritization tool.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: OVA is freely accessible at\nhttp://dna2.leeds.ac.uk:8080/OVA/index.jsp.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\nCONTACT: umaan@leeds.ac.uk.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Thus, the robust assignment of new cases to major CLL subsets\nis a critical, and yet unmet, requirement.\nRESULTS: We introduce a novel application, ARResT/AssignSubsets, which enables\nthe robust assignment of BcR IG sequences from CLL patients to major stereotyped \nsubsets. ARResT/AssignSubsets uniquely combines expert immunogenetic sequence\nannotation from IMGT/V-QUEST with curation to safeguard quality, statistical\nmodeling of sequence features from more than 7500 CLL patients, and results from \nmultiple perspectives to allow for both objective and subjective assessment.

Kinase dependency does not always correspond with gene\nexpression and mutation status. High-throughput drug screens are powerful tools\nfor determining kinase dependency, but drug polypharmacology can make results\ndifficult to interpret.\nRESULTS: We developed Kinase Addiction Ranker (KAR), an algorithm that integrates\nhigh-throughput drug screening data, comprehensive kinase inhibition data and\ngene expression profiles to identify kinase dependency in cancer cells. We\napplied KAR to predict kinase dependency of 21 lung cancer cell lines and 151\nleukemia patient samples using published datasets. We experimentally validated\nKAR predictions of FGFR and MTOR dependence in lung cancer cell line H1581,\nshowing synergistic reduction in proliferation after combining ponatinib and\nAZD8055.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: KAR can be downloaded as a Python function or a \nMATLAB script along with example inputs and outputs at:\nhttp://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/KAR/.\nCONTACT: aikchoon.tan@ucdenver.edu.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Some\ncomputational methods treat this problem as a ranking problem and achieve the\nstate-of-the-art performance, such as PSI-BLAST, HHblits and ProtEmbed. This\nraises the possibility to combine these methods to improve the predictive\nperformance. In this regard, we are to propose a new computational method called \nProtDec-LTR for protein remote homology detection, which is able to combine\nvarious ranking methods in a supervised manner via using the Learning to Rank\n(LTR) algorithm derived from natural language processing.\nRESULTS: Experimental results on a widely used benchmark dataset showed that\nProtDec-LTR can achieve an ROC1 score of 0.8442 and an ROC50 score of 0.9023\noutperforming all the individual predictors and some state-of-the-art methods.\nThese results indicate that it is correct to treat protein remote homology\ndetection as a ranking problem, and predictive performance improvement can be\nachieved by combining different ranking approaches in a supervised manner via\nusing LTR.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: For users' convenience, the software tools of\nthree basic ranking predictors and Learning to Rank algorithm were provided at\nhttp://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/ProtDec-LTR/home/\nCONTACT: bliu@insun.hit.edu.cn\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

All those RNAs that\ndo not become proteins are called 'non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)', which outnumbers\nprotein-coding genes. Interestingly, these ncRNAs are shown to be more tissue\nspecifically expressed than protein-coding genes. Given that tissue-specific\nexpressions of transcripts suggest their importance in the expressed tissue,\nresearchers are conducting biological experiments to elucidate the function of\nsuch ncRNAs. Owing greatly to the advancement of next-generation techniques,\nespecially RNA-seq, the amount of high-throughput data are increasing rapidly.\nHowever, due to the complexity of the data as well as its high volume, it is not \neasy to re-analyze such data to extract tissue-specific expressions of ncRNAs\nfrom published datasets.\nRESULTS: Here, we introduce a new knowledge database called 'C-It-Loci', which\nallows a user to screen for tissue-specific transcripts across three organisms:\nhuman, mouse and zebrafish. C-It-Loci is intuitive and easy to use to identify\nnot only protein-coding genes but also ncRNAs from various tissues. C-It-Loci\ndefines homology through sequence and positional conservation to allow for the\nextraction of species-conserved loci. C-It-Loci can be used as a starting point\nfor further biological experiments.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: C-It-Loci is freely available online without\nregistration at http://c-it-loci.uni-frankfurt.de.\nCONTACT: uchida@med.uni-frankfurt.de\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Monte Carlo\nrejection sampling, a fundamental component of ABC algorithms, is trivial to\ndistribute over multiple processors but is inherently inefficient. While\ndevelopment of algorithms such as ABC Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) help\naddress the inherent inefficiencies of rejection sampling, such approaches are\nnot as easily scaled on multiple processors. As a result, current Bayesian\ninference software offerings that use ABC-SMC lack the ability to scale in\nparallel computing environments.\nRESULTS: We present al3c, a C++ framework for implementing ABC-SMC in parallel.\nBy requiring only that users define essential functions such as the simulation\nmodel and prior distribution function, al3c abstracts the user from both the\ncomplexities of parallel programming and the details of the ABC-SMC algorithm. By\nusing the al3c framework, the user is able to scale the ABC-SMC algorithm in\nparallel computing environments for his or her specific application, with minimal\nprogramming overhead.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: al3c is offered as a static binary for Linux and\nOS-X computing environments. The user completes an XML configuration file and C++\nplug-in template for the specific application, which are used by al3c to obtain\nthe desired results.

(2)Department of Biomedical Sciences\nand School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State\nUniversity, Corvallis, OR, USA.\n\nMOTIVATION: The position-weight matrix (PWM) is a useful representation of a\ntranscription factor binding site (TFBS) sequence pattern because the PWM can be \nestimated from a small number of representative TFBS sequences. However, because \nthe PWM probability model assumes independence between individual nucleotide\npositions, the PWMs for some TFs poorly discriminate binding sites from\nnon-binding-sites that have similar sequence content. Since the local\nthree-dimensional DNA structure ('shape') is a determinant of TF binding\nspecificity and since DNA shape has a significant sequence-dependence, we\ncombined DNA shape-derived features into a TF-generalized regulatory score and\ntested whether the score could improve PWM-based discrimination of TFBS from\nnon-binding-sites.\nRESULTS: We compared a traditional PWM model to a model that combines the PWM\nwith a DNA shape feature-based regulatory potential score, for accuracy in\ndetecting binding sites for 75 vertebrate transcription factors. The PWM+shape\nmodel was more accurate than the PWM-only model, for 45% of TFs tested, with no\nsignificant loss of accuracy for the remaining TFs.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The shape-based model is available as an\nopen-source R package at that is archived on the GitHub software repository at\nhttps://github.com/ramseylab/regshape/.\nCONTACT: stephen.ramsey@oregonstate.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Current algorithms can infer\nstructures from information-rich contact maps that contain a limited fraction of \nerroneous predictions. However, it is difficult to reconstruct 3D structures from\npredicted contact maps that usually contain a high fraction of false contacts.\nRESULTS: We describe a new, multi-step protocol that predicts protein 3D\nstructures from the predicted contact maps. The method is based on a novel\ndistance function acting on a fuzzy residue proximity graph, which predicts a 2D \ndistance map from a 2D predicted contact map. The application of a\nMulti-Dimensional Scaling algorithm transforms that predicted 2D distance map\ninto a coarse 3D model, which is further refined by typical modeling programs\ninto an all-atom representation. We tested our approach on contact maps predicted\nde novo by MULTICOM, the top contact map predictor according to CASP10. We show\nthat our method outperforms FT-COMAR, the state-of-the-art method for 3D\nstructure reconstruction from 2D maps. For all predicted 2D contact maps of\nrelatively low sensitivity (60-84%), GDFuzz3D generates more accurate 3D models, \nwith the average improvement of 4.87 Å in terms of RMSD.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GDFuzz3D server and standalone version are\nfreely available at http://iimcb.genesilico.pl/gdserver/GDFuzz3D/.\nCONTACT: iamb@genesilico.pl\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Unfortunately, manual curation and functional knowledge lag\nbehind. Homologous inference often fails at labeling proteins with diverse\nfunctions and broad classes. Thus, identifying high-level protein functionality\nremains challenging. We hypothesize that a universal feature engineering approach\ncan yield classification of high-level functions and unified properties when\ncombined with machine learning approaches, without requiring external databases\nor alignment.\nRESULTS: In this study, we present a novel bioinformatics toolkit called ProFET\n(Protein Feature Engineering Toolkit). ProFET extracts hundreds of features\ncovering the elementary biophysical and sequence derived attributes. Most\nfeatures capture statistically informative patterns. In addition, different\nrepresentations of sequences and the amino acids alphabet provide a compact,\ncompressed set of features. The results from ProFET were incorporated in data\nanalysis pipelines, implemented in python and adapted for multi-genome scale\nanalysis. ProFET was applied on 17 established and novel protein benchmark\ndatasets involving classification for a variety of binary and multi-class tasks. \nThe results show state of the art performance. The extracted features' show\nexcellent biological interpretability. The success of ProFET applies to a wide\nrange of high-level functions such as subcellular localization, structural\nclasses and proteins with unique functional properties (e.g. neuropeptide\nprecursors, thermophilic and nucleic acid binding). ProFET allows easy, universal\ndiscovery of new target proteins, as well as understanding the features\nunderlying different high-level protein functions.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ProFET source code and the datasets used are\nfreely available at https://github.com/ddofer/ProFET.\nCONTACT: michall@cc.huji.ac.il\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Sequences are automatically cleaned, trimmed, size selected and mapped\ndirectly to miRNA hairpin sequences. This generates count-based miRNA expression \ndata for subsequent statistical analysis. Moreover, it is capable of identifying \nepi-transcriptomic modifications in the input sequences. Supported modification\ntypes include multiple types of 3'-modifications (e.g. uridylation, adenylation),\n5'-modifications and also internal modifications or variation (ADAR editing or\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms). Besides cleaning and mapping of input sequences\nto miRNAs, Chimira provides a simple and intuitive set of tools for the analysis \nand interpretation of the results (see also Supplementary Material). These allow \nthe visual study of the differential expression between two specific samples or\nsets of samples, the identification of the most highly expressed miRNAs within\nsample pairs (or sets of samples) and also the projection of the modification\nprofile for specific miRNAs across all samples. Other tools have already been\npublished in the past for various types of small RNA-Seq analysis, such as UEA\nworkbench, seqBuster, MAGI, OASIS and CAP-miRSeq, CPSS for modifications\nidentification. A comprehensive comparison of Chimira with each of these tools is\nprovided in the Supplementary Material.

These multi-subunit complexes can be difficult to analyze at the level\nof amino acid sequence in combination with the 3D structural organization of the \ncomplex. Therefore, novel tools for simultaneous analysis of structure and\nsequence information of complex assemblies are required to better understand the \nbasis of molecular mechanisms and their functional implications.\nRESULTS: Here, we present a web-based tool, Integrative Biology of Sequences and \nStructures (IBiSS), which is designed for interactively displaying 3D structures \nand selected sequences of subunits from large macromolecular complexes thus\nallowing simultaneous structure-sequence analysis such as conserved residues\ninvolved in catalysis or protein-protein interfaces.

Such analysis is often challenged by censored,\nsmall-sample-size, but high-dimensional genomic profiles or clinical data.\nTherefore, sophisticated models and algorithms are in pressing need.\nRESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel Area Under Curve (AUC) optimization\nmethod for multi-biomarker panel identification named Nearest Centroid Classifier\nfor AUC optimization (NCC-AUC). Our method is motived by the connection between\nAUC score for classification accuracy evaluation and Harrell's concordance index \nin survival analysis. This connection allows us to convert the survival time\nregression problem to a binary classification problem. Then an optimization model\nis formulated to directly maximize AUC and meanwhile minimize the number of\nselected features to construct a predictor in the nearest centroid classifier\nframework. NCC-AUC shows its great performance by validating both in genomic data\nof breast cancer and clinical data of stage IB Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer\n(NSCLC). For the genomic data, NCC-AUC outperforms Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nand Support Vector Machine-based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) in\nclassification accuracy. It tends to select a multi-biomarker panel with low\naverage redundancy and enriched biological meanings. Also NCC-AUC is more\nsignificant in separation of low and high risk cohorts than widely used Cox model\n(Cox proportional-hazards regression model) and L1-Cox model (L1 penalized in Cox\nmodel). These performance gains of NCC-AUC are quite robust across 5 subtypes of \nbreast cancer. Further in an independent clinical data, NCC-AUC outperforms SVM\nand SVM-RFE in predictive accuracy and is consistently better than Cox model and \nL1-Cox model in grouping patients into high and low risk categories.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, NCC-AUC provides a rigorous optimization framework to\nsystematically reveal multi-biomarker panel from genomic and clinical data. It\ncan serve as a useful tool to identify prognostic biomarkers for survival\nanalysis.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: NCC-AUC is available at\nhttp://doc.aporc.org/wiki/NCC-AUC.\nCONTACT: ywang@amss.ac.cn\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

In contrast to traditional bulk sequencing, single-cell\nsequencing requires the amplification of the whole genome of a single cell to\naccumulate enough samples for sequencing. However, the amplification process\ninevitably introduces amplification bias, resulting in an over-dispersing portion\nof the sequencing data. Recent study has manifested that the over-dispersed\nportion of the single-cell sequencing data could be well modelled by negative\nbinomial distributions.\nRESULTS: We developed a read-depth based method, nbCNV to detect the copy number \nvariants (CNVs). The nbCNV method uses two constraints-sparsity and smoothness to\nfit the CNV patterns under the assumption that the read signals are negatively\nbinomially distributed. The problem of CNV detection was formulated as a\nquadratic optimization problem, and was solved by an efficient numerical solution\nbased on the classical alternating direction minimization method.\nCONCLUSIONS: Extensive experiments to compare nbCNV with existing benchmark\nmodels were conducted on both simulated data and empirical single-cell sequencing\ndata. The results of those experiments demonstrate that nbCNV achieves superior\nperformance and high robustness for the detection of CNVs in single-cell\nsequencing data.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1239-7 \nPMCID: PMC5027123\nPMID: 27639558  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Usually, the location is measured \nby ChIP-seq and analyzed with a peak-caller. Replicated ChIP-seq experiments\nbecome more and more available. However, their analysis is based on\nsingle-experiment peak-calling or on tools like PePr which allows peak-calling of\nreplicates but whose underlying model might not be suitable for the conditions\nunder which the experiments are performed.\nRESULTS: We propose a new peak-caller called 'Sierra Platinum' that allows\npeak-calling of replicated ChIP-seq experiments.

Recently, lncRNAs have been\nwidely identified across eukaryotes and many databases of lncRNAs have been\ndeveloped for human, mouse, fruit fly, etc. However, there is rare information\nabout them in the only completely domesticated insect, silkworm (Bombyx mori).\nDESCRIPTION: In this study, we systematically scanned lncRNAs using the available\nsilkworm RNA-seq data and public unigenes. Finally, we identified and collected\n6281 lncRNAs in the silkworm. Besides, we also collected 1986 microRNAs (miRNAs) \nfrom previous studies. Then, we organized them into a comprehensive and web-based\ndatabase, BmncRNAdb.

Although statistical methods that have been\ndeveloped for microarray data can be applied to RNA-Seq data, they are not ideal \ndue to the discrete nature of RNA-Seq data. The Poisson distribution and negative\nbinomial distribution are commonly used to model count data. Recently, Witten\n(Annals Appl Stat 5:2493-2518, 2011) proposed a Poisson linear discriminant\nanalysis for RNA-Seq data. The Poisson assumption may not be as appropriate as\nthe negative binomial distribution when biological replicates are available and\nin the presence of overdispersion (i.e., when the variance is larger than or\nequal to the mean). However, it is more complicated to model negative binomial\nvariables because they involve a dispersion parameter that needs to be estimated.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we propose a negative binomial linear discriminant\nanalysis for RNA-Seq data. By Bayes' rule, we construct the classifier by fitting\na negative binomial model, and propose some plug-in rules to estimate the unknown\nparameters in the classifier. The relationship between the negative binomial\nclassifier and the Poisson classifier is explored, with a numerical investigation\nof the impact of dispersion on the discriminant score. Simulation results show\nthe superiority of our proposed method. We also analyze two real RNA-Seq data\nsets to demonstrate the advantages of our method in real-world applications.\nCONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new classifier using the negative binomial model\nfor RNA-seq data classification. Our simulation results show that our proposed\nclassifier has a better performance than existing works. The proposed classifier \ncan serve as an effective tool for classifying RNA-seq data. Based on the\ncomparison results, we have provided some guidelines for scientists to decide\nwhich method should be used in the discriminant analysis of RNA-Seq data.

However,\ncurrently available functional enrichment tools need to be updated frequently to \nadapt to new entries from the functional database repositories. Hence there is a \nneed for a simplified tool that can perform functional enrichment analysis by\nusing updated information directly from the source databases such as KEGG,\nReactome or Gene Ontology etc.\nRESULTS: In this study, we focused on designing a command-line tool called\nGeneSCF (Gene Set Clustering based on Functional annotations), that can predict\nthe functionally relevant biological information for a set of genes in a\nreal-time updated manner. It is designed to handle information from more than\n4000 organisms from freely available prominent functional databases like KEGG,\nReactome and Gene Ontology. We successfully employed our tool on two of published\ndatasets to predict the biologically relevant functional information. The core\nfeatures of this tool were tested on Linux machines without the need for\ninstallation of more dependencies.\nCONCLUSIONS: GeneSCF is more reliable compared to other enrichment tools because \nof its ability to use reference functional databases in real-time to perform\nenrichment analysis. It is an easy-to-integrate tool with other pipelines\navailable for downstream analysis of high-throughput data. More importantly,\nGeneSCF can run multiple gene lists simultaneously on different organisms thereby\nsaving time for the users. Since the tool is designed to be ready-to-use, there\nis no need for any complex compilation and installation procedures.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1250-z \nPMCID: PMC5020511\nPMID: 27618934  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Recent advances\nin genome sequencing technologies have remarkably increased the efficiency to\npinpoint genes involved in the adaptive evolution of phenotypes. Reliability of\nsuch findings is most often examined with statistical and computational methods\nusing Maximum Likelihood codon-based models (i.e., site, branch, branch-site and \nclade models), such as those available in codeml from the Phylogenetic Analysis\nby Maximum Likelihood (PAML) package. While these models represent a well-defined\nworkflow for documenting adaptive evolution, in practice they can be challenging \nfor researchers having a vast amount of data, as multiple types of relevant\ncodon-based datasets are generated, making the overall process hard and tedious\nto handle, error-prone and time-consuming.\nRESULTS: We introduce LMAP (Lightweight Multigene Analyses in PAML), a\nuser-friendly command-line and interactive package, designed to handle the codeml\nworkflow, namely: directory organization, execution, results gathering and\norganization for Likelihood Ratio Test estimations with minimal manual user\nintervention. LMAP was developed for the workstation multi-core environment and\nprovides a unique advantage for processing one, or more, if not all codeml\ncodon-based models for multiple datasets at a time. Our software, proved\nefficiency throughout the codeml workflow, including, but not limited, to\nsimultaneously handling more than 20 datasets.\nCONCLUSIONS: We have developed a simple and versatile LMAP package, with\noutstanding performance, enabling researchers to analyze multiple different\ncodon-based datasets in a high-throughput fashion. At minimum, two file types are\nrequired within a single input directory: one for the multiple sequence alignment\nand another for the phylogenetic tree. To our knowledge, no other software\ncombines all codeml codon substitution models of adaptive evolution.

Existing tests for network enrichment\nanalysis deal only with undirected networks, they can be computationally slow and\nare based on normality assumptions.\nRESULTS: We propose NEAT, a test for network enrichment analysis. The test is\nbased on the hypergeometric distribution, which naturally arises as the null\ndistribution in this context. NEAT can be applied not only to undirected, but to \ndirected and partially directed networks as well. Our simulations indicate that\nNEAT is considerably faster than alternative resampling-based methods, and that\nits capacity to detect enrichments is at least as good as the one of alternative \ntests. We discuss applications of NEAT to network analyses in yeast by testing\nfor enrichment of the Environmental Stress Response target gene set with GO Slim \nand KEGG functional gene sets, and also by inspecting associations between\nfunctional sets themselves.\nCONCLUSIONS: NEAT is a flexible and efficient test for network enrichment\nanalysis that aims to overcome some limitations of existing resampling-based\ntests.

In spite of IPF essential applications,\nit has not been investigated as much as PSP problem. In fact, the ultimate goal\nof IPF problem or protein design is to create proteins with enhanced properties\nor even novel functions. One of the major computational challenges in protein\ndesign is its large sequence space, namely searching through all plausible\nsequences is impossible. Inasmuch as, protein secondary structure represents an\nappropriate primary scaffold of the protein conformation, undoubtedly studying\nthe Protein Secondary Structure Inverse Folding (PSSIF) problem is a quantum leap\nforward in protein design, as it can reduce the search space. In this paper, a\nnovel genetic algorithm which uses native secondary sub-structures is proposed to\nsolve PSSIF problem. In essence, evolutionary information can lead the algorithm \nto design appropriate amino acid sequences respective to the target secondary\nstructures. Furthermore, they can be folded to tertiary structures almost similar\nto their reference 3D structures.\nRESULTS: The proposed algorithm called GAPSSIF benefits from evolutionary\ninformation obtained by solved proteins in the PDB. Therefore, we construct a\nrepository of protein secondary sub-structures to accelerate convergence of the\nalgorithm. The secondary structure of designed sequences by GAPSSIF is comparable\nwith those obtained by Evolver and EvoDesign. Although we do not explicitly\nconsider tertiary structure features through the algorithm, the structural\nsimilarity of native and designed sequences declares acceptable values.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using the evolutionary information of native structures can\nsignificantly improve the quality of designed sequences. In fact, the combination\nof this information and effective features such as solvent accessibility and\ntorsion angles leads IPF problem to an efficient solution.

It\nclassifies sequences into two types: normally related and distantly related. For \nnormally related sequences, it uses an adaptive approach to construct the guide\ntree needed for progressive alignment; it first estimates the input's discrepancy\nby computing the standard deviation of their percent identities, and based on\nthis estimate, it chooses the better method to construct the guide tree. For\ndistantly related sequences, PnpProbs abandons the guide tree and uses instead\nsome non-progressive alignment method to generate the alignment.\nRESULTS: To evaluate PnpProbs, we have compared it with thirteen other popular\nMSA tools, and PnpProbs has the best alignment scores in all but one test. We\nhave also used it for phylogenetic analysis, and found that the phylogenetic\ntrees constructed from PnpProbs' alignments are closest to the model trees.\nCONCLUSIONS: By combining the strength of the progressive and non-progressive\nalignment methods, we have developed an MSA tool called PnpProbs. We have\ncompared PnpProbs with thirteen other popular MSA tools and our results showed\nthat our tool usually constructed the best alignments.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1121-7 \nPMCID: PMC5009527\nPMID: 27585754  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

A number of methods for computing disease\nsimilarity had been developed; however, none of them were designed to utilize\ninformation of the entire protein interaction network, using instead only those\ninteractions involving disease causing genes. Most of previously published\nmethods required gene-disease association data, unfortunately, many diseases\nstill have very few or no associated genes, which impeded broad adoption of those\nmethods. In this study, we propose a new method (MedNetSim) for computing disease\nsimilarity by integrating medical literature and protein interaction network.\nMedNetSim consists of a network-based method (NetSim), which employs the entire\nprotein interaction network, and a MEDLINE-based method (MedSim), which computes \ndisease similarity by mining the biomedical literature.\nRESULTS: Among function-based methods, NetSim achieved the best performance. Its \naverage AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) reached\n95.2 %. MedSim, whose performance was even comparable to some function-based\nmethods, acquired the highest average AUC in all semantic-based methods.\nIntegration of MedSim and NetSim (MedNetSim) further improved the average AUC to \n96.4 %. We further studied the effectiveness of different data sources. It was\nfound that quality of protein interaction data was more important than its\nvolume. On the contrary, higher volume of gene-disease association data was more \nbeneficial, even with a lower reliability. Utilizing higher volume of\ndisease-related gene data further improved the average AUC of MedNetSim and\nNetSim to 97.5 % and 96.7 %, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Integrating biomedical literature and protein interaction network\ncan be an effective way to compute disease similarity. Lacking sufficient\ndisease-related gene data, literature-based methods such as MedSim can be a great\naddition to function-based algorithms. It may be beneficial to steer more\nresources torward studying gene-disease associations and improving the quality of\nprotein interaction data. Disease similarities can be computed using the proposed\nmethods at http:// www.digintelli.com:8000/ .\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1205-4 \nPMCID: PMC5006367\nPMID: 27578323  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Accurate\ndetection of copy number alterations is necessary for discovering cancer-causing \ngenes. Whole-exome sequencing has become a widely used technology in the last\ndecade for detecting various types of genomic aberrations in cancer genomes.\nHowever, there are several major issues encountered in these detection problems, \nincluding normal cell contamination, tumor aneuploidy, and intra-tumor\nheterogeneity. Especially, deciphering the intra-tumor heterogeneity is\nimperative for identifying clonal and subclonal copy number alterations.\nRESULTS: We introduce CloneCNA, a novel bioinformatics tool for efficiently\naddressing these issues and automatically detecting clonal and subclonal somatic \ncopy number alterations from heterogeneous tumor samples. CloneCNA fully explores\nthe log ratio of read counts between paired tumor-normal samples and tumor B\nallele frequency of germline heterozygous SNP positions, further employs\nefficient statistical models to quantitatively represent copy number status of\ntumor sample containing multiple clones. We examine CloneCNA on simulated\nheterogeneous and real tumor samples, and the results demonstrate that CloneCNA\nhas higher power to detect copy number alterations than existing methods.\nCONCLUSIONS: CloneCNA, a novel algorithm is developed to efficiently and\naccurately identify somatic copy number alterations from heterogeneous tumor\nsamples. We demonstrate the statistical framework of CloneCNA represents a\nremarkable advance for tumor whole-exome sequencing data. We expect that CloneCNA\nwill promote cancer-focused studies for investigating the role of clonal\nevolution and elucidating critical events benefiting tumor tumourigenesis and\nprogression.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1174-7 \nPMCID: PMC4990858\nPMID: 27538789  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

It is\noften quite difficult to tell from these raw results whether the search has been \na success or has picked-up sequences with little or no relationship to the query.\nThe best approach to this problem is to cluster and align the resulting families,\nhowever, existing methods concentrate on fast clustering and either do not align \nthe sequences or only perform a limited alignment.\nRESULTS: A method (MULSEL) is presented that combines fast peptide-based\npre-sorting with a following cascade of mini-alignments, each of which are\ngenerated with a robust profile/profile method. From these mini-alignments, a\nrepresentative sequence is selected, based on a variety of intrinsic and\nuser-specified criteria that are combined to produce the sequence collection for \nthe next cycle of alignment. For moderate sized sequence collections (10s of\nthousands) the method executes on a laptop computer within seconds or minutes.\nCONCLUSIONS: MULSEL bridges a gap between fast clustering methods and slower\nmultiple sequence alignment methods and provides a seamless transition from one\nto the other.

It has\nbecome widely used in many bioinformatics applications for annotating genes and\nmeasuring their semantic similarity, rather than their sequence similarity.\nGenerally speaking, semantic similarity measures involve the GO tree topology,\ninformation content of GO terms, or a combination of both.\nRESULTS: Here we present a new semantic similarity measure called TopoICSim\n(Topological Information Content Similarity) which uses information on the\nspecific paths between GO terms based on the topology of the GO tree, and the\ndistribution of information content along these paths. The TopoICSim algorithm\nwas evaluated on two human benchmark datasets based on KEGG pathways and Pfam\ndomains grouped as clans, using GO terms from either the biological process or\nmolecular function. The performance of the TopoICSim measure compared favorably\nto five existing methods. Furthermore, the TopoICSim similarity was also tested\non gene/protein sets defined by correlated gene expression, using three human\ndatasets, and showed improved performance compared to two previously published\nsimilarity measures. Finally we used an online benchmarking resource which\nevaluates any similarity measure against a set of 11 similarity measures in three\ntests, using gene/protein sets based on sequence similarity, Pfam domains, and\nenzyme classifications. The results for TopoICSim showed improved performance\nrelative to most of the measures included in the benchmarking, and in particular \na very robust performance throughout the different tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: The TopoICSim similarity measure provides a competitive method with \nrobust performance for quantification of semantic similarity between genes and\nproteins based on GO annotations.

(3)Department of\nComputer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, 47907, IN, USA.\n\nBACKGROUND: Comparing phenotypes of heterogeneous cell populations from multiple \nbiological conditions is at the heart of scientific discovery based on flow\ncytometry (FC). When the biological signal is measured by the average expression \nof a biomarker, standard statistical methods require that variance be\napproximately stabilized in populations to be compared. Since the mean and\nvariance of a cell population are often correlated in fluorescence-based FC\nmeasurements, a preprocessing step is needed to stabilize the within-population\nvariances.\nRESULTS: We present a variance-stabilization algorithm, called flowVS, that\nremoves the mean-variance correlations from cell populations identified in each\nfluorescence channel. flowVS transforms each channel from all samples of a data\nset by the inverse hyperbolic sine (asinh) transformation. For each channel, the \nparameters of the transformation are optimally selected by Bartlett's\nlikelihood-ratio test so that the populations attain homogeneous variances. The\noptimum parameters are then used to transform the corresponding channels in every\nsample. flowVS is therefore an explicit variance-stabilization method that\nstabilizes within-population variances in each channel by evaluating the\nhomoskedasticity of clusters with a likelihood-ratio test. With two publicly\navailable datasets, we show that flowVS removes the mean-variance dependence from\nraw FC data and makes the within-population variance relatively homogeneous. We\ndemonstrate that alternative transformation techniques such as flowTrans,\nflowScape, logicle, and FCSTrans might not stabilize variance. Besides flow\ncytometry, flowVS can also be applied to stabilize variance in microarray data.\nWith a publicly available data set we demonstrate that flowVS performs as well as\nthe VSN software, a state-of-the-art approach developed for microarrays.\nCONCLUSIONS: The homogeneity of variance in cell populations across FC samples is\ndesirable when extracting features uniformly and comparing cell populations with \ndifferent levels of marker expressions. The newly developed flowVS algorithm\nsolves the variance-stabilization problem in FC and microarrays by optimally\ntransforming data with the help of Bartlett's likelihood-ratio test. On two\npublicly available FC datasets, flowVS stabilizes within-population variances\nmore evenly than the available transformation and normalization techniques.\nflowVS-based variance stabilization can help in performing comparison and\nalignment of phenotypically identical cell populations across different samples. \nflowVS and the datasets used in this paper are publicly available in\nBioconductor.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1083-9 \nPMCID: PMC4964071\nPMID: 27465477  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Biological networks can be generated that examine the interaction between \nproteins or the relationship amongst different genes at the expression level.\nIdentifying information from biological networks is recognized as a significant\nchallenge, due to the inherent complexity of the structures.

Several network\ntopological measures have been computed and fed as features into two\nclassification models to investigate phenotype-gene association in breast cancer.\nMore importantly, to overcome the problem of the skewed datasets, a synthetic\nminority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is adapted in order to transform an\nimbalanced dataset to a balanced one.

Applications include 3D structure modelling, protein\nfunctional annotation, prediction of molecular interactions, etc. These\napplications, however sophisticated, are generally highly sensitive to the\nalignment used, and neglecting non-homologous or uncertain regions in the\nalignment can lead to significant bias in the subsequent inferences.\nRESULTS: Here, we present a new method, LEON-BIS, which uses a robust Bayesian\nframework to estimate the homologous relations between sequences in a protein\nmultiple alignment. Sequences are clustered into sub-families and relations are\npredicted at different levels, including 'core blocks', 'regions' and full-length\nproteins. The accuracy and reliability of the predictions are demonstrated in\nlarge-scale comparisons using well annotated alignment databases, where the\nhomologous sequence segments are detected with very high sensitivity and\nspecificity.\nCONCLUSIONS: LEON-BIS uses robust Bayesian statistics to distinguish the portions\nof multiple sequence alignments that are conserved either across the whole family\nor within subfamilies.

A number of systems have emphasized\ncustom development of ChIP-seq pipelines. These systems are primarily based on\ncustom programming of a single, complex pipeline or supply libraries of modules\nand do not produce the full range of outputs commonly produced for ChIP-seq\ndatasets. It is desirable to have more comprehensive pipelines, in particular\nones addressing common metadata tasks, such as pathway analysis, and pipelines\nproducing standard complex graphical outputs. It is advantageous if these are\nhighly modular systems, available as both turnkey pipelines and individual\nmodules, that are easily comprehensible, modifiable and extensible to allow rapid\nalteration in response to new analysis developments in this growing area.\nFurthermore, it is advantageous if these pipelines allow data provenance\ntracking.\nRESULTS: We present a set of 20 ChIP-seq analysis software modules implemented in\nthe Kepler workflow system; most (18/20) were also implemented as standalone,\nfully functional R scripts.

Implementation emphasized use of common R packages and widely-used\nexternal tools (e.g., MACS for peak finding), along with custom programming. This\nsoftware presents comprehensive solutions and easily repurposed code blocks for\nChIP-seq analysis and pipeline creation. Tasks include mapping raw reads,\npeakfinding via MACS, summary statistics, peak location statistics, summary plots\ncentered on the transcription start site (TSS), gene ontology, pathway analysis, \nand de novo motif finding, among others.\nCONCLUSIONS: These pipelines range from those performing a single task to those\nperforming full analyses of ChIP-seq data. The pipelines are supplied as both\nKepler workflows, which allow data provenance tracking, and, in the majority of\ncases, as standalone R scripts. These pipelines are designed for ease of\nmodification and repurposing.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1125-3 \nPMCID: PMC4932705\nPMID: 27377783  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most\nimportant crops in human and livestock diets, and the development of wheat\nvarieties that produce higher yields, combined with increased resistance to pests\nand resilience to changes in climate, has meant that wheat breeding has become an\nimportant focus of scientific research. In an attempt to facilitate these\nimprovements in wheat, plant breeders have employed molecular tools to help them \nidentify genes for important agronomic traits that can be bred into new\nvarieties. Modern molecular techniques have ensured that the rapid and\ninexpensive characterisation of SNP markers and their validation with modern\ngenotyping methods has produced a valuable resource that can be used in marker\nassisted selection. CerealsDB was created as a means of quickly disseminating\nthis information to breeders and researchers around the globe.\nDESCRIPTION: CerealsDB version 3.0 is an online resource that contains a wide\nrange of genomic datasets for wheat that will assist plant breeders and\nscientists to select the most appropriate markers for use in marker assisted\nselection. CerealsDB includes a database which currently contains in excess of a \nmillion putative varietal SNPs, of which several hundreds of thousands have been \nexperimentally validated. In addition, CerealsDB also contains new data on\nfunctional SNPs predicted to have a major effect on protein function and we have \nconstructed a web service to encourage data integration and high-throughput\nprogrammatic access.\nCONCLUSION: CerealsDB is an open access website that hosts information on SNPs\nthat are considered useful for both plant breeders and research scientists. The\nrecent inclusion of web services designed to federate genomic data resources\nallows the information on CerealsDB to be more fully integrated with the WheatIS \nnetwork and other biological databases.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1139-x \nPMCID: PMC4919907\nPMID: 27342803  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

(5)Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne,\nSwitzerland. rudi.gunawan@chem.ethz.ch.\n\nBACKGROUND: The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from transcriptional\nexpression profiles is challenging, predominantly due to its underdetermined\nnature. One important consequence of underdetermination is the existence of many \npossible solutions to this inference. Our previously proposed ensemble inference \nalgorithm TRaCE addressed this issue by inferring an ensemble of network directed\ngraphs (digraphs) using differential gene expressions from gene knock-out (KO)\nexperiments. However, TRaCE could not deal with the mode of the transcriptional\nregulations (activation or repression), an important feature of GRNs.\nRESULTS: In this work, we developed a new algorithm called TRaCE+ for the\ninference of an ensemble of signed GRN digraphs from transcriptional expression\ndata of gene KO experiments. The sign of the edges indicates whether the\nregulation is an activation (positive) or a repression (negative). TRaCE+\ngenerates the upper and lower bounds of the ensemble, which define uncertain\nregulatory interactions that could not be verified by the data. As demonstrated\nin the case studies using Escherichia coli GRN and 100-gene gold-standard GRNs\nfrom DREAM 4 network inference challenge, by accounting for regulatory signs,\nTRaCE+ could extract more information from the KO data than TRaCE, leading to\nfewer uncertain edges. Importantly, iterating TRaCE+ with an optimal design of\ngene KOs could resolve the underdetermined issue of GRN inference in much fewer\nKO experiments than using TRaCE.\nCONCLUSIONS: TRaCE+ expands the applications of ensemble GRN inference strategy\nby accounting for the mode of the gene regulatory interactions. In comparison to \nTRaCE, TRaCE+ enables a better utilization of gene KO data, thereby reducing the \ncost of tackling underdetermined GRN inference. TRaCE+ subroutines for MATLAB are\nfreely available at the following website:\nhttp://www.cabsel.ethz.ch/tools/trace.html .\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1137-z \nPMCID: PMC4919846\nPMID: 27342648  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

For microbes, the key phenotype is the growth in population size\nbecause it contains information that is directly linked to fitness. Due to\ntechnical innovations and extensive automation our capacity to record complex and\ndynamic microbial growth data is rapidly outpacing our capacity to dissect and\nvisualize this data and extract the fitness components it contains, hampering\nprogress in all fields of microbiology.\nRESULTS: To automate visualization, analysis and exploration of complex and\nhighly resolved microbial growth data as well as standardized extraction of the\nfitness components it contains, we developed the software PRECOG (PREsentation\nand Characterization Of Growth-data). PRECOG allows the user to quality control, \ninteract with and evaluate microbial growth data with ease, speed and accuracy,\nalso in cases of non-standard growth dynamics. Quality indices filter high- from \nlow-quality growth experiments, reducing false positives. The pre-processing\nfilters in PRECOG are computationally inexpensive and yet functionally comparable\nto more complex neural network procedures. We provide examples where data\ncalibration, project design and feature extraction methodologies have a clear\nimpact on the estimated growth traits, emphasising the need for proper\nstandardization in data analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: PRECOG is a tool that streamlines growth data pre-processing,\nphenotypic trait extraction, visualization, distribution and the creation of vast\nand informative phenomics databases.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1134-2 \nPMCID: PMC4917999\nPMID: 27334112  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Obviously, this\nstrategy could not identify peptide and protein sequences that are absent from a \nreference database. A customized protein database on the basis of RNA-Seq data is\nthus proposed to assist with and improve the identification of novel peptides.\nCorrespondingly, development of a comprehensive pipeline, which provides an\nend-to-end solution for novel peptide detection with the customized protein\ndatabase, is necessary.\nRESULTS: A pipeline with an R package, assigned as a PGA utility, was developed\nthat enables automated treatment to the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data\nacquired from different MS platforms and construction of customized protein\ndatabases based on RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome guide. Hence, \nPGA can identify novel peptides and generate an HTML-based report with a\nvisualized interface. On the basis of a published dataset, PGA was employed to\nidentify peptides, resulting in 636 novel peptides, including 510 single amino\nacid polymorphism (SAP) peptides, 2 INDEL peptides, 49 splice junction peptides, \nand 75 novel transcript-derived peptides.

In practice, many\npublished genome sequences remain in the state of a large set of contigs. Each\ncontig describes the sequence found along some path of the assembly graph,\nhowever, the set of contigs does not record all the sequence information\ncontained in that graph. Although many subsequent analyses can be performed with \nthe set of contigs, one may ask whether mapping reads on the contigs is as\ninformative as mapping them on the paths of the assembly graph. Currently, one\nlacks practical tools to perform mapping on such graphs.\nRESULTS: Here, we propose a formal definition of mapping on a de Bruijn graph,\nanalyse the problem complexity which turns out to be NP-complete, and provide a\npractical solution. We propose a pipeline called GGMAP (Greedy Graph MAPping).\nIts novelty is a procedure to map reads on branching paths of the graph, for\nwhich we designed a heuristic algorithm called BGREAT (de Bruijn Graph REAd\nmapping Tool). For the sake of efficiency, BGREAT rewrites a read sequence as a\nsuccession of unitigs sequences. GGMAP can map millions of reads per CPU hour on \na de Bruijn graph built from a large set of human genomic reads. Surprisingly,\nresults show that up to 22 % more reads can be mapped on the graph but not on the\ncontig set.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although mapping reads on a de Bruijn graph is complex task, our\nproposal offers a practical solution combining efficiency with an improved\nmapping capacity compared to assembly-based mapping even for complex eukaryotic\ndata.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1103-9 \nPMCID: PMC4910249\nPMID: 27306641  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Although several methods have been\ndeveloped to fully analyze the single-cell expression data, there is still room\nfor improvement in the analysis of differentiation.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we propose a novel method SCOUP to elucidate\ndifferentiation process. Unlike previous dimension reduction-based approaches,\nSCOUP describes the dynamics of gene expression throughout differentiation\ndirectly, including the degree of differentiation of a cell (in pseudo-time) and \ncell fate. SCOUP is superior to previous methods with respect to pseudo-time\nestimation, especially for single-cell RNA-seq. SCOUP also successfully estimates\ncell lineage more accurately than previous method, especially for cells at an\nearly stage of bifurcation. In addition, SCOUP can be applied to various\ndownstream analyses. As an example, we propose a novel correlation calculation\nmethod for elucidating regulatory relationships among genes. We apply this method\nto a single-cell RNA-seq data and detect a candidate of key regulator for\ndifferentiation and clusters in a correlation network which are not detected with\nconventional correlation analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: We develop a stochastic process-based method SCOUP to analyze\nsingle-cell expression data throughout differentiation.

Some, such \nas Gbrowse and Jbrowse, are very efficient for small genomic regions, but they\nare not suitable for entire genomes. Others, like Phenogram and CViT, can be used\nto visualise whole genomes, but are not designed to display very dense genomic\nfeatures (eg: interspersed repeats). We have therefore developed DensityMap, a\nlightweight Perl program that can display the densities of several features\n(genes, ncRNA, cpg, etc.) along chromosomes on the scale of the whole genome. A\ncritical advantage of DensityMap is that it uses GFF annotation files directly to\ncompute the densities of features without needing additional information from the\nuser. The resulting picture is readily configurable, and the colour scales used\ncan be customized for a best fit to the data plotted.\nRESULTS: DensityMap runs on Linux architecture with few requirements so that\nusers can easily and quickly visualize the distributions and densities of genomic\nfeatures for an entire genome. The input is GFF3-formated data representing\nchromosomes (linkage groups or pseudomolecules) and sets of features which are\nused to calculate representations in density maps. In practise, DensityMap uses a\ntilling window to compute the density of one or more features and the number of\nbases covered by these features along chromosomes. The densities are represented \nby colour scales that can be customized to highlight critical points. DensityMap \ncan compare the distributions of features; it calculates several chromosomal\ndensity maps in a single image, each of which describes a different genomic\nfeature. It can also use the genome nucleotide sequence to compute and plot a\ndensity map of the GC content along chromosomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: DensityMap is a compact, easily-used tool for displaying the\ndistribution and density of all types of genomic features within a genome. It is \nflexible enough to visualize the densities of several types of features in a\nsingle representation. The images produced are readily configurable and their SVG\nformat ensures that they can be edited.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1055-0 \nPMCID: PMC4858867\nPMID: 27153821  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

BAM is the standard exchange format for aligned\nsequencing reads, thus correct format implementation is paramount for software\ninteroperability and correct analysis. However, TopHat writes its unmapped reads \nin a way that is not compatible with other software that implements the SAM/BAM\nformat.\nRESULTS: We have developed TopHat-Recondition, a post-processor for TopHat\nunmapped reads that restores read information in the proper format.\nTopHat-Recondition thus enables downstream software to process the plethora of\nBAM files written by TopHat.\nCONCLUSIONS: TopHat-Recondition can repair unmapped read files written by TopHat \nand is freely available under a 2-clause BSD license on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/cbrueffer/tophat-recondition .\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1058-x \nPMCID: PMC4855331\nPMID: 27142976  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Indeed membrane components of eukaryotic cells are very dynamic \nmolecules and can diffuse according to different motion modes. Trajectories are\noften reconstructed frame-by-frame and dynamic properties often evaluated using\nmean square displacement (MSD) analysis. However, to get statistically\nsignificant results in tracking experiments, analysis of a large number of\ntrajectories is required and new methods facilitating this analysis are still\nneeded.\nRESULTS: In this study we developed a new algorithm based on back-propagation\nneural network (BPNN) and MSD analysis using a sliding window. The neural network\nwas trained and cross validated with short synthetic trajectories. For simulated \nand experimental data, the algorithm was shown to accurately discriminate between\nBrownian, confined and directed diffusion modes within one trajectory, the 3 main\nof diffusion encountered for proteins diffusing within biological membranes. It\ndoes not require a minimum number of observed particle displacements within the\ntrajectory to infer the presence of multiple motion states. The size of the\nsliding window was small enough to measure local behavior and to detect switches \nbetween different diffusion modes for segments as short as 20 frames. It also\nprovides quantitative information from each segment of these trajectories.\nBesides its ability to detect switches between 3 modes of diffusion, this\nalgorithm is able to analyze simultaneously hundreds of trajectories with a short\ncomputational time.\nCONCLUSION: This new algorithm, implemented in powerful and handy software,\nprovides a new conceptual and versatile tool, to accurately analyze the dynamic\nbehavior of membrane components.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1064-z \nPMCID: PMC4855490\nPMID: 27141816  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

In 2008, Styczynski et al. discovered miscalculations in the\nclustering step of the matrix computation. Still, the RBLOSUM64 matrix based on\nthe corrected BLOSUM code was reported to perform worse at a statistically\nsignificant level than the BLOSUM62. Here, we present a further correction of the\n(R)BLOSUM code and provide a thorough performance analysis of BLOSUM-, RBLOSUM-\nand the newly derived CorBLOSUM-type matrices. Thereby, we assess homology search\nperformance of these matrix-types derived from three different BLOCKS databases\non all versions of the ASTRAL20, ASTRAL40 and ASTRAL70 subsets resulting in 51\ndifferent benchmarks in total. Our analysis is focused on two of the most popular\nBLOSUM matrices - BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62.\nRESULTS: Our study shows that fixing small errors in the BLOSUM code results in\nsubstantially different substitution matrices with a beneficial influence on\nhomology search performance when compared to the original matrices. The CorBLOSUM\nmatrices introduced here performed at least as good as their BLOSUM counterparts \nin ∼75 % of all test cases. On up-to-date ASTRAL databases BLOSUM matrices were\neven outperformed by CorBLOSUM matrices in more than 86 % of the times. In\ncontrast to the study by Styczynski et al., the tested RBLOSUM matrices also\noutperformed the corresponding BLOSUM matrices in most of the cases. Comparing\nthe CorBLOSUM with the RBLOSUM matrices revealed no general performance\nadvantages for either on older ASTRAL releases. On up-to-date ASTRAL databases\nhowever CorBLOSUM matrices performed better than their RBLOSUM counterparts in\n∼74 % of the test cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that CorBLOSUM type matrices outperform the BLOSUM\nmatrices on a statistically significant level in most of the cases, especially on\nup-to-date databases such as ASTRAL ≥2.01. Additionally, CorBLOSUM matrices are\ncloser to those originally intended by Henikoff and Henikoff on a conceptual\nlevel. Hence, we encourage the usage of CorBLOSUM over (R)BLOSUM matrices for the\ntask of homology search.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1060-3 \nPMCID: PMC4849092\nPMID: 27122148  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Furthermore, to understand the differences in\nbehaviour of system(s) under various environmental conditions (e.g. stress,\ninfection), comparing multiple networks becomes necessary. Such comparisons\nbetween multiple networks may help in asserting causation and in identifying key \ncomponents of the studied biological system(s). Although many available network\ncomparison methods exist, which employ techniques like network alignment and\nquerying to compute pair-wise similarity between selected networks, most of them \nhave limited features with respect to interactive visual comparison of multiple\nnetworks.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we present CompNet - a graphical user interface based\nnetwork comparison tool, which allows visual comparison of multiple networks\nbased on various network metrics. CompNet allows interactive visualization of the\nunion, intersection and/or complement regions of a selected set of networks.\nDifferent visualization features (e.g. pie-nodes, edge-pie matrix, etc.) aid in\neasy identification of the key nodes/interactions and their significance across\nthe compared networks. The tool also allows one to perform network comparisons on\nthe basis of neighbourhood architecture of constituent nodes and community\ncompositions, a feature particularly useful while analyzing biological networks. \nTo demonstrate the utility of CompNet, we have compared a (time-series) human\ngene-expression dataset, post-infection by two strains of Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis, overlaid on the human protein-protein interaction network. Using\nvarious functionalities of CompNet not only allowed us to comprehend changes in\ninteraction patterns over the course of infection, but also helped in inferring\nthe probable fates of the host cells upon infection by the two strains.\nCONCLUSIONS: CompNet is expected to be a valuable visual data mining tool and is \nfreely available for academic use from http://metagenomics.atc.tcs.com/compnet/\nor http://121.241.184.233/compnet/.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1013-x \nPMCID: PMC4845442\nPMID: 27112575  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Pyrosequencing errors, consisting mainly of nucleotide insertions \nand deletions, are on the other hand likely to disrupt open reading frames. Such \nan inverse relationship between errors and expectation based on prior knowledge\ncan be used advantageously to guide the process known as basecalling, i.e. the\ninference of nucleotide sequence from raw sequencing data.\nRESULTS: The new basecalling method described here, named Multipass, implements a\nprobabilistic framework for working with the raw flowgrams obtained by\npyrosequencing. For each sequence variant Multipass calculates the likelihood and\nnucleotide sequence of several most likely sequences given the flowgram data.\nThis probabilistic approach enables integration of basecalling into a larger\nmodel where other parameters can be incorporated, such as the likelihood for\nobserving a full-length open reading frame at the targeted region. We apply the\nmethod to 454 amplicon pyrosequencing data obtained from a malaria virulence gene\nfamily, where Multipass generates 20 % more error-free sequences than current\nstate of the art methods, and provides sequence characteristics that allow\ngeneration of a set of high confidence error-free sequences.\nCONCLUSIONS: This novel method can be used to increase accuracy of existing and\nfuture amplicon sequencing data, particularly where extensive prior knowledge is \navailable about the obtained sequences, for example in analysis of the\nimmunoglobulin VDJ region where Multipass can be combined with a model for the\nknown recombining germline genes. Multipass is available for Roche 454 data at\nhttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MultiPass-1.0 , and the concept can potentially be\nimplemented for other sequencing technologies as well.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1032-7 \nPMCID: PMC4841065\nPMID: 27102804  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

While large amounts\nof sequencing data are being generated, the associated analysis and\ninterpretation of mutation patterns that may reveal clues about the natural\nhistory of cancer present complex and challenging tasks that require advanced\nbioinformatics skills. To make such analyses accessible to a wider community of\nresearchers with no programming expertise, we have developed within the web-based\nuser-friendly platform Galaxy a first-of-its-kind package called MutSpec.\nRESULTS: MutSpec includes a set of tools that perform variant annotation and use \nadvanced statistics for the identification of mutation signatures present in\ncancer genomes and for comparing the obtained signatures with those published in \nthe COSMIC database and other sources. MutSpec offers an accessible framework for\nbuilding reproducible analysis pipelines, integrating existing methods and\nscripts developed in-house with publicly available R packages. MutSpec may be\nused to analyse data from whole-exome, whole-genome or targeted sequencing\nexperiments performed on human or mouse genomes. Results are provided in various \nformats including rich graphical outputs. An example is presented to illustrate\nthe package functionalities, the straightforward workflow analysis and the\nrichness of the statistics and publication-grade graphics produced by the tool.\nCONCLUSIONS: MutSpec offers an easy-to-use graphical interface embedded in the\npopular Galaxy platform that can be used by researchers with limited programming \nor bioinformatics expertise to analyse mutation signatures present in cancer\ngenomes. MutSpec can thus effectively assist in the discovery of complex\nmutational processes resulting from exogenous and endogenous carcinogenic\ninsults.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1011-z \nPMCID: PMC4835840\nPMID: 27091472  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Until now, more than 2500 mature miRNAs in human have \nbeen discovered and registered, but still lack of information or algorithms to\nreveal the relations among miRNAs, environmental chemicals and human health.\nChemicals in environment affect our health and daily life, and some of them can\nlead to diseases by inferring biological pathways.\nRESULTS: We develop a creditable online web server, ChemiRs, for predicting\ninteractions and relations among miRNAs, chemicals and pathways. The database not\nonly compares gene lists affected by chemicals and miRNAs, but also incorporates \ncurated pathways to identify possible interactions.\nCONCLUSIONS: Here, we manually retrieved associations of miRNAs and chemicals\nfrom biomedical literature. We developed an online system, ChemiRs, which\ncontains miRNAs, diseases, Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms, chemicals,\ngenes, pathways and PubMed IDs. We connected each miRNA to miRBase, and every\ncurrent gene symbol to HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) for genome\nannotation.

ROVER permits stringent filtering of\nsequencing chemistry-induced errors by requiring reported variants to appear in\nboth reads of overlapping pairs above certain thresholds of occurrence. ROVER was\ndeveloped in tandem with Hi-Plex and has been used successfully to screen for\ngenetic mutations in the breast cancer predisposition gene PALB2. ROVER is\napplied to MPS data in BAM format and, therefore, relies on sequence reads being \nmapped to a reference genome. In this paper, we describe an improvement to ROVER,\ncalled UNDR ROVER (Unmapped primer-Directed ROVER), which accepts MPS data in\nFASTQ format, avoiding the need for a computationally expensive mapping stage. It\ndoes so by taking advantage of the location-specific nature of PCR-targeted MPS\ndata.\nRESULTS: The UNDR ROVER algorithm achieves the same stringent variant calling as \nits predecessor with a significant runtime performance improvement. In one\nindicative sequencing experiment, UNDR ROVER (in its fastest mode) required\n8-fold less sequential computation time than the ROVER pipeline and 13-fold less \nsequential computation time than a variant calling pipeline based on the popular \nGATK tool. UNDR ROVER is implemented in Python and runs on all popular POSIX-like\noperating systems (Linux, OS X). It requires as input a tab-delimited format file\ncontaining primer sequence information, a FASTA format file containing the\nreference genome sequence, and paired FASTQ files containing sequence reads.\nPrimer sequences at the 5' end of reads associate read-pairs with their targeted \namplicon and, thus, their expected corresponding coordinates in the reference\ngenome. The primer-intervening sequence of each read is compared against the\nreference sequence from the same location and variants are identified using the\nsame algorithm as ROVER. Specifically, for a variant to be 'called' it must\nappear at the same location in both of the overlapping reads above user-defined\nthresholds of minimum number of reads and proportion of reads.\nCONCLUSIONS: UNDR ROVER provides the same rapid and accurate genetic variant\ncalling as its predecessor with greatly reduced computational costs.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1014-9 \nPMCID: PMC4833922\nPMID: 27083325  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

In a semantic network, the types of the nodes \nand links are different. In order to take into account the heterogeneity of the\nsemantic network, meta-path-based topological patterns were investigated for link\nprediction.\nRESULTS: Supervised machine learning models were constructed based on meta-path\ntopological features of an enriched semantic network, which was derived from\nChem2Bio2RDF, and was expanded by adding compound and protein similarity\nneighboring links obtained from the PubChem databases. The additional semantic\nlinks significantly improved the predictive performance of the supervised\nlearning models. The binary classification model built upon the enriched feature \nspace using the Random Forest algorithm significantly outperformed an existing\nsemantic link prediction algorithm, Semantic Link Association Prediction (SLAP), \nto predict unknown links between compounds and protein targets in an evolving\nnetwork. In addition to link prediction, Random Forest also has an intrinsic\nfeature ranking algorithm, which can be used to select the important topological \nfeatures that contribute to link prediction.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework has been demonstrated as a powerful\nalternative to SLAP in order to predict DTIs using the semantic network that\nintegrates chemical, pharmacological, genomic, biological, functional, and\nbiomedical information into a unified framework. It offers the flexibility to\nenrich the feature space by using different normalization processes on the\ntopological features, and it can perform model construction and feature selection\nat the same time.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1005-x \nPMCID: PMC4830032\nPMID: 27071755  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

A relaxed form of\nCH alleles may account for an essential proportion of the missing heritability,\ni.e. heritability of phenotypes so far not accounted for by single genetic\nvariants. Methods to detect CH-like effects in genome-wide association studies\n(GWAS) may facilitate explaining the missing heritability, but to our knowledge\nno viable software tools for this purpose are currently available.\nRESULTS: In this work we present the Generalized Compound Double Heterozygosity\n(GCDH) test and its implementation in the R package CollapsABEL. Time-consuming\nprocedures are optimized for computational efficiency using Java or C++.\nIntermediate results are stored either in an SQL database or in a so-called\nbig.matrix file to achieve reasonable memory footprint. Our large scale\nsimulation studies show that GCDH is capable of discovering genetic associations \ndue to CH-like interactions with much higher power than a conventional single-SNP\napproach under various settings, whether the causal genetic variations are\navailable or not. CollapsABEL provides a user-friendly pipeline for genotype\ncollapsing, statistical testing, power estimation, type I error control and\ngraphics generation in the R language.\nCONCLUSIONS: CollapsABEL provides a computationally efficient solution for\nscreening general forms of CH alleles in densely imputed microarray or whole\ngenome sequencing datasets. The GCDH test provides an improved power over\nsingle-SNP based methods in detecting the prevalence of CH in human complex\nphenotypes, offering an opportunity for tackling the missing heritability\nproblem.

Importantly for this study,\nthe identification of stable structured region is a crucial first step to\ngenerate novel synthetic antibodies. While many approaches to find domains or\npredict structured regions exist, important limitations remain, such as the\noptimization of domain boundaries and the lack of identification of non-domain\nstructured units. Moreover, no integrated tool exists to find and optimize\nstructural domains within protein sequences.\nRESULTS: Here, we describe a new tool, PAT ( http://www.kimlab.org/software/pat )\nthat can efficiently identify both domains (with optimized boundaries) and\nnon-domain putative structured units. PAT automatically analyzes various\nstructural properties, evaluates the folding stability, and reports possible\nstructural domains in a given protein sequence. For reliability evaluation of\nPAT, we applied PAT to identify antibody target molecules based on the notion\nthat soluble and well-defined protein secondary and tertiary structures are\nappropriate target molecules for synthetic antibodies.\nCONCLUSION: PAT is an efficient and sensitive tool to identify structured units. \nA performance analysis shows that PAT can characterize structurally well-defined \nregions in a given sequence and outperforms other efforts to define reliable\nboundaries of domains. Specially, PAT successfully identifies experimentally\nconfirmed target molecules for antibody generation. PAT also offers the\npre-calculated results of 20,210 human proteins to accelerate common queries. PAT\ncan therefore help to investigate large-scale structured domains and improve the \nsuccess rate for synthetic antibody generation.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1001-1 \nPMCID: PMC4818438\nPMID: 27039071  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Workflows rest\nupon the notion of splitting complex work into the joint effort of several\nmanageable tasks. There are several engines that give users the ability to design\nand execute workflows. Each engine was created to address certain problems of a\nspecific community, therefore each one has its advantages and shortcomings.\nFurthermore, not all features of all workflow engines are royalty-free -an aspect\nthat could potentially drive away members of the scientific community.\nRESULTS: We have developed a set of tools that enables the scientific community\nto benefit from workflow interoperability. We developed a platform-free\nstructured representation of parameters, inputs, outputs of command-line tools in\nso-called Common Tool Descriptor documents. We have also overcome the\nshortcomings and combined the features of two royalty-free workflow engines with \na substantial user community: the Konstanz Information Miner, an engine which we \nsee as a formidable workflow editor, and the Grid and User Support Environment, a\nweb-based framework able to interact with several high-performance computing\nresources. We have thus created a free and highly accessible way to design\nworkflows on a desktop computer and execute them on high-performance computing\nresources.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work will not only reduce time spent on designing scientific\nworkflows, but also make executing workflows on remote high-performance computing\nresources more accessible to technically inexperienced users.

PeTTSy is a package for MATLAB which\nimplements a wide array of techniques for the perturbation theory and sensitivity\nanalysis of large and complex ordinary differential equation (ODE) based models. \nPeTTSy is a comprehensive modelling framework that introduces a number of new\napproaches and that fully addresses analysis of oscillatory systems. It examines \nsensitivity analysis of the models to perturbations of parameters, where the\nperturbation timing, strength, length and overall shape can be controlled by the \nuser. This can be done in a system-global setting, namely, the user can determine\nhow many parameters to perturb, by how much and for how long. PeTTSy also offers \nthe user the ability to explore the effect of the parameter perturbations on many\ndifferent types of outputs: period, phase (timing of peak) and model solutions.\nPeTTSy can be employed on a wide range of mathematical models including\nfree-running and forced oscillators and signalling systems. To enable\nexperimental optimisation using the Fisher Information Matrix it efficiently\nallows one to combine multiple variants of a model (i.e. a model with multiple\nexperimental conditions) in order to determine the value of new experiments. It\nis especially useful in the analysis of large and complex models involving many\nvariables and parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: PeTTSy is a comprehensive tool for analysing large and complex\nmodels of regulatory and signalling systems. It allows for simulation and\nanalysis of models under a variety of environmental conditions and for\nexperimental optimisation of complex combined experiments. With its unique set of\ntools it makes a valuable addition to the current library of sensitivity analysis\ntoolboxes. We believe that this software will be of great use to the wider\nbiological, systems biology and modelling communities.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0972-2 \nPMCID: PMC4785672\nPMID: 26964749  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Most of related\nelaborations can be carried out by combining existing tools at different levels, \nbut little is currently available for the automation of the fundamental steps.\nFor the analysis of MALDI/TOF spectra, a number of pre-processing steps are\nrequired, including joining of isotopic abundances for a given molecular species,\nnormalization of signals against an internal standard, background noise removal, \naveraging multiple spectra from the same sample, and aligning spectra from\ndifferent samples. In this paper, we present Geena 2, a public software tool for \nthe automated execution of these pre-processing steps for MALDI/TOF spectra.\nRESULTS: Geena 2 has been developed in a Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP web development\nenvironment, with scripts in PHP and Perl. Input and output are managed as simple\nformats that can be consumed by any database system and spreadsheet software.\nInput data may also be stored in a MySQL database. Processing methods are based\non original heuristic algorithms which are introduced in the paper. Three simple \nand intuitive web interfaces are available: the Standard Search Interface, which \nallows a complete control over all parameters, the Bright Search Interface, which\nleaves to the user the possibility to tune parameters for alignment of spectra,\nand the Quick Search Interface, which limits the number of parameters to a\nminimum by using default values for the majority of parameters. Geena 2 has been \nutilized, in conjunction with a statistical analysis tool, in three published\nexperimental works: a proteomic study on the effects of long-term\ncryopreservation on the low molecular weight fraction of serum proteome, and two \nretrospective serum proteomic studies, one on the risk of developing breat cancer\nin patients affected by gross cystic disease of the breast (GCDB) and the other\nfor the identification of a predictor of breast cancer mortality following breast\ncancer surgery, whose results were validated by ELISA, a completely alternative\nmethod.\nCONCLUSIONS: Geena 2 is a public tool for the automated pre-processing of MS data\noriginated by MALDI/TOF instruments, with a simple and intuitive web interface.\nIt is now under active development for the inclusion of further filtering options\nand for the adoption of standard formats for MS spectra.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0911-2 \nPMCID: PMC4896264\nPMID: 26961516  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Residues\nforming an active site, whether it is a catalytic center or interaction\ninterface, are frequently distant in a protein sequence. Hence, traditional\nsequence-based prediction methods focusing on a single residue (or a short window\nof residues) at a time may have difficulties in identifying and clustering the\nresidues constituting a functional site, especially when a protein has multiple\nfunctions. Evolutionary information encoded in multiple sequence alignments is\nknown to greatly improve sequence-based predictions. Identification of coevolving\nresidues further advances the protein structure and function annotation by\nrevealing cooperative pairs and higher order groupings of residues.\nRESULTS: We present a new web-based tool (CoeViz) that provides a versatile\nanalysis and visualization of pairwise coevolution of amino acid residues. The\ntool computes three covariance metrics: mutual information, chi-square statistic,\nPearson correlation, and one conservation metric: joint Shannon entropy.\nImplemented adjustments of covariance scores include phylogeny correction,\ncorrections for sequence dissimilarity and alignment gaps, and the average\nproduct correction. Visualization of residue relationships is enhanced by\nhierarchical cluster trees, heat maps, circular diagrams, and the residue\nhighlighting in protein sequence and 3D structure. Unlike other existing tools,\nCoeViz is not limited to analyzing conserved domains or protein families and can \nprocess long, unstructured and multi-domain proteins thousands of residues long. \nTwo examples are provided to illustrate the use of the tool for identification of\nresidues (1) involved in enzymatic function, (2) forming short linear functional \nmotifs, and (3) constituting a structural domain.\nCONCLUSIONS: CoeViz represents a practical resource for a quick sequence-based\nprotein annotation for molecular biologists, e.g., for identifying putative\nfunctional clusters of residues and structural domains. CoeViz also can serve\ncomputational biologists as a resource of coevolution matrices, e.g., for\ndeveloping machine learning-based prediction models.

Currently, the most\nsuccessful methods use powerful classifiers, such as support vector machines with\nvarious string kernels. However, with the rapid evolution of our ability to\ncollect genomic information, it has been shown that combining many sources of\nevidence is fundamental to the success of any recognition task. With the advent\nof next-generation sequencing, the number of available genomes is increasing very\nrapidly. Thus, methods for making use of such large amounts of information are\nneeded.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we present a methodology for combining tens or even\nhundreds of different classifiers for an improved performance. Our approach can\ninclude almost a limitless number of sources of evidence. We can use the evidence\nfor the prediction of sites in a certain species, such as human, or other species\nas needed. This approach can be used for any of the functional recognition tasks \ncited above. However, to provide the necessary focus, we have tested our approach\nin two functional recognition tasks: translation initiation site and stop codon\nrecognition. We have used the entire human genome as a target and another 20\nspecies as sources of evidence and tested our method on five different human\nchromosomes. The proposed method achieves better accuracy than the best\nstate-of-the-art method both in terms of the geometric mean of the specificity\nand sensitivity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic and\nprecision recall curves. Furthermore, our approach shows a more principled way\nfor selecting the best genomes to be combined for a given recognition task.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our approach has proven to be a powerful tool for improving the\nperformance of functional site recognition, and it is a useful method for\ncombining many sources of evidence for any recognition task in Bioinformatics.\nThe results also show that the common approach of heuristically choosing the\nspecies to be used as source of evidence can be improved because the best\ncombinations of genomes for recognition were those not usually selected. Although\nthe experiments were performed for translation initiation site and stop codon\nrecognition, any other recognition task may benefit from our methodology.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0968-y \nPMCID: PMC4779560\nPMID: 26945666  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The first nanopore sequencer available, the MinION™ \nfrom Oxford Nanopore Technologies, is a USB-connected, portable device that\nallows real-time DNA analysis. In addition, other new instruments are expected to\nbe released soon, which promise to outperform the current short-read technologies\nin terms of throughput. Despite the flood of data expected from this technology, \nthe data analysis solutions currently available are only designed to manage small\nprojects and are not scalable.\nRESULTS: Here we present HPG Pore, a toolkit for exploring and analysing nanopore\nsequencing data. HPG Pore can run on both individual computers and in the Hadoop \ndistributed computing framework, which allows easy scale-up to manage the large\namounts of data expected to result from extensive use of nanopore technologies in\nthe future.\nCONCLUSIONS: HPG Pore allows for virtually unlimited sequencing data scalability,\nthus guaranteeing its continued management in near future scenarios.

The study of protein complexes is an effective strategy\nto analyze cellular functions and biological processes. With the increasing\navailability of proteomics data, various computational methods have recently been\ndeveloped to predict protein complexes. However, different computational methods \nare based on their own assumptions and designed to work on different data\nsources, and various biological screening methods have their unique experiment\nconditions, and are often different in scale and noise level. Therefore, a single\ncomputational method on a specific data source is generally not able to generate \ncomprehensive and reliable prediction results.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we develop a novel Two-layer INtegrative Complex\nDetection (TINCD) model to detect protein complexes, leveraging the information\nfrom both clustering results and raw data sources. In particular, we first\nintegrate various clustering results to construct consensus matrices for proteins\nto measure their overall co-complex propensity. Second, we combine these\nconsensus matrices with the co-complex score matrix derived from Tandem Affinity \nPurification/Mass Spectrometry (TAP) data and obtain an integrated co-complex\nsimilarity network via an unsupervised metric fusion method. Finally, a novel\ngraph regularized doubly stochastic matrix decomposition model is proposed to\ndetect overlapping protein complexes from the integrated similarity network.\nCONCLUSIONS: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that TINCD performs much \nbetter than 21 state-of-the-art complex detection techniques, including ensemble \nclustering and data integration techniques.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0939-3 \nPMCID: PMC4765032\nPMID: 26911324  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Sequenced metagenomic samples usually comprise reads from a large number\nof different bacterial communities and hence tend to result in large file sizes, \ntypically ranging between 1-10 GB. This leads to challenges in analyzing,\ntransferring and storing metagenomic data. In order to overcome these data\nprocessing issues, we introduce MetaCRAM, the first de novo, parallelized\nsoftware suite specialized for FASTA and FASTQ format metagenomic read processing\nand lossless compression.\nRESULTS: MetaCRAM integrates algorithms for taxonomy identification and assembly,\nand introduces parallel execution methods; furthermore, it enables genome\nreference selection and CRAM based compression. MetaCRAM also uses novel\nreference-based compression methods designed through extensive studies of integer\ncompression techniques and through fitting of empirical distributions of\nmetagenomic read-reference positions. MetaCRAM is a lossless method compatible\nwith standard CRAM formats, and it allows for fast selection of relevant files in\nthe compressed domain via maintenance of taxonomy information. The performance of\nMetaCRAM as a stand-alone compression platform was evaluated on various\nmetagenomic samples from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive, suggesting 2- to 4-fold \ncompression ratio improvements compared to gzip. On average, the compressed file \nsizes were 2-13 percent of the original raw metagenomic file sizes.\nCONCLUSIONS: We described the first architecture for reference-based, lossless\ncompression of metagenomic data. The compression scheme proposed offers\nsignificantly improved compression ratios as compared to off-the-shelf methods\nsuch as zip programs. Furthermore, it enables running different components in\nparallel and it provides the user with taxonomic and assembly information\ngenerated during execution of the compression pipeline.\nAVAILABILITY: The MetaCRAM software is freely available at\nhttp://web.engr.illinois.edu/~mkim158/metacram.html. The website also contains a \nREADME file and other relevant instructions for running the code. Note that to\nrun the code one needs a minimum of 16 GB of RAM. In addition, virtual box is set\nup on a 4GB RAM machine for users to run a simple demonstration.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0932-x \nPMCID: PMC4759986\nPMID: 26895947  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

In this study, we describe an\napproach to decrease annotation errors of protein families characterized by low\noverall sequence similarity. The GDSL lipolytic family comprises proteins with\nmultifunctional properties and high potential for pharmaceutical and industrial\napplications. The number of proteins assigned to this family has increased\nrapidly over the last few years. In particular, the natural abundance of GDSL\nenzymes reported recently in plants indicates that they could be a good source of\nnovel GDSL enzymes. We noticed that a significant proportion of annotated\nsequences lack specific GDSL motif(s) or catalytic residue(s). Here, we applied\nmotif-based sequence analyses to identify enzymes possessing conserved GDSL\nmotifs in selected proteomes across the plant kingdom.\nRESULTS: Motif-based HMM scanning (Viterbi decoding-VD and posterior decoding-PD)\nand the here described PD/VD protocol were successfully applied on 12 selected\nplant proteomes to identify sequences with GDSL motifs. A significant number of\nidentified GDSL sequences were novel. Moreover, our scanning approach\nsuccessfully detected protein sequences lacking at least one of the essential\nmotifs (171/820) annotated by Pfam profile search (PfamA) as GDSL. Based on these\nanalyses we provide a curated list of GDSL enzymes from the selected plants.\nCLANS clustering and phylogenetic analysis helped us to gain a better insight\ninto the evolutionary relationship of all identified GDSL sequences. Three novel \nGDSL subfamilies as well as unreported variations in GDSL motifs were discovered \nin this study. In addition, analyses of selected proteomes showed a remarkable\nexpansion of GDSL enzymes in the lycophyte, Selaginella moellendorffii. Finally, \nwe provide a general motif-HMM scanner which is easily accessible through the\ngraphical user interface ( http://compbio.math.hr/ ).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show that scanning with a carefully parameterized\nmotif-HMM is an effective approach for annotation of protein families with low\nsequence similarity and conserved motifs. The results of this study expand\ncurrent knowledge and provide new insights into the evolution of the large\nGDSL-lipase family in land plants.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0919-7 \nPMCID: PMC4757993\nPMID: 26892257  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Though various fast Smith-Waterman local sequence\nalignment implementations have been developed for x86 CPUs, most are embedded\ninto larger database search tools. In addition, fast implementations of\nNeedleman-Wunsch global sequence alignment and its semi-global variants are not\nas widespread. This article presents the first software library for local,\nglobal, and semi-global pairwise intra-sequence alignments and improves the\nperformance of previous intra-sequence implementations.\nRESULTS: A faster intra-sequence local pairwise alignment implementation is\ndescribed and benchmarked, including new global and semi-global variants. Using a\n375 residue query sequence a speed of 136 billion cell updates per second (GCUPS)\nwas achieved on a dual Intel Xeon E5-2670 24-core processor system, the highest\nreported for an implementation based on Farrar's 'striped' approach. Rognes's\nSWIPE optimal database search application is still generally the fastest\navailable at 1.2 to at best 2.4 times faster than Parasail for sequences shorter \nthan 500 amino acids. However, Parasail was faster for longer sequences. For\nglobal alignments, Parasail's prefix scan implementation is generally the\nfastest, faster even than Farrar's 'striped' approach, however the opal library\nis faster for single-threaded applications. The software library is designed for \n64 bit Linux, OS X, or Windows on processors with SSE2, SSE41, or AVX2.

However, the computational tools for finding open \nreading frames are sufficiently slow that they are becoming a bottleneck as the\nvolume of sequence data grows. This computational bottleneck is especially\nproblematic in metagenomics when searching unassembled reads, or screening\nassembled contigs for genes of interest. Here, we present OrfM, a tool to rapidly\nidentify open reading frames (ORFs) in sequence data by applying the Aho-Corasick\nalgorithm to find regions uninterrupted by stop codons. Benchmarking revealed\nthat OrfM finds identical ORFs to similar tools ('GetOrf' and 'Translate') but is\nfour-five times faster. While OrfM is sequencing platform-agnostic, it is best\nsuited to large, high quality datasets such as those produced by Illumina\nsequencers.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code and binaries are freely\navailable for download at http://github.com/wwood/OrfM or through GNU Guix under \nthe LGPL 3+ license.

As powerful tools to study such 3D chromatin\nconformation, the recently developed Hi-C technologies enable a genome-wide\nmeasurement of pair-wise chromatin interaction. However, methods for the\ndetection of biologically meaningful chromatin interactions, i.e. peak calling,\nfrom Hi-C data, are still under development. In our previous work, we have\ndeveloped a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) based Bayesian method, which \nthrough explicitly modeling the non-negligible spatial dependency among adjacent \npairs of loci manifesting in high resolution Hi-C data, achieves substantially\nimproved robustness and enhanced statistical power in peak calling. Superior to\npeak callers that ignore spatial dependency both methodologically and in\nperformance, our previous Bayesian framework suffers from heavy computational\ncosts due to intensive computation incurred by modeling the correlated peak\nstatus of neighboring loci pairs and the inference of hidden dependency\nstructure.\nRESULTS: In this work, we have developed FastHiC, a novel approach based on\nsimulated field approximation, which approximates the joint distribution of the\nhidden peak status by a set of independent random variables, leading to more\ntractable computation. Performance comparisons in real data analysis showed that \nFastHiC not only speeds up our original Bayesian method by more than five times, \nbus also achieves higher peak calling accuracy.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: FastHiC is freely accessible\nat:http://www.unc.edu/∼yunmli/FastHiC/ CONTACTS: : yunli@med.unc.edu or\nming.hu@nyumc.org\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Such tests, which rely on analyzing the read coverage or\nthe allelic ratios at single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, are not\nsensitive enough for smaller sub-chromosomal abnormalities due to sequencing\nbiases and paucity of SNPs in a genome.\nRESULTS: We have developed an alternative framework for identifying\nsub-chromosomal copy number variations in a fetal genome. This framework relies\non the size distribution of fragments in a sample, as fetal-origin fragments tend\nto be smaller than those of maternal origin. By analyzing the local distribution \nof the cell-free DNA fragment sizes in each region, our method allows for the\nidentification of sub-megabase CNVs, even in the absence of SNP positions. To\nevaluate the accuracy of our method, we used a plasma sample with the fetal\nfraction of 13%, down-sampled it to samples with coverage of 10X-40X and\nsimulated samples with CNVs based on it. Our method had a perfect accuracy (both \nspecificity and sensitivity) for detecting 5 Mb CNVs, and after reducing the\nfetal fraction (to 11%, 9% and 7%), it could correctly identify 98.82-100% of the\n5 Mb CNVs and had a true-negative rate of 95.29-99.76%.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our source code is available on GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/compbio-UofT/FSDA CONTACT: : brudno@cs.toronto.edu.\n\n© The Author 2016.

We apply SinQC to nine different scRNA-seq datasets, and show that\nSinQC is a useful tool for controlling scRNA-seq data quality.AVAILABILITY AND\nIMPLEMENTATION: SinQC software and documents are available at\nhttp://www.morgridge.net/SinQC.html\nCONTACTS: : PJiang@morgridge.org or RStewart@morgridge.org\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

(2)Department of Molecular Medicine (MOMA), Aarhus University\nHospital, Aarhus N 8200, Denmark Bioinformatics Research Centre, Aarhus\nUniversity, Aarhus C DK-8000, Denmark.\n\nMOTIVATION: Recently, new RNA secondary structure probing techniques have been\ndeveloped, including Next Generation Sequencing based methods capable of probing \ntranscriptome-wide. These techniques hold great promise for improving structure\nprediction accuracy. However, each new data type comes with its own signal\nproperties and biases, which may even be experiment specific. There is therefore \na growing need for RNA structure prediction methods that can be automatically\ntrained on new data types and readily extended to integrate and fully exploit\nmultiple types of data.\nRESULTS: Here, we develop and explore a modular probabilistic approach for\nintegrating probing data in RNA structure prediction. It can be automatically\ntrained given a set of known structures with probing data. The approach is\ndemonstrated on SHAPE datasets, where we evaluate and selectively model specific \ncorrelations. The approach often makes superior use of the probing data signal\ncompared to other methods. We illustrate the use of ProbFold on multiple data\ntypes using both simulations and a small set of structures with both SHAPE, DMS\nand CMCT data. Technically, the approach combines stochastic context-free\ngrammars (SCFGs) with probabilistic graphical models. This approach allows rapid \nadaptation and integration of new probing data types.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ProbFold is implemented in C ++. Models are\nspecified using simple textual formats. Data reformatting is done using separate \nC ++ programs. Source code, statically compiled binaries for x86 Linux machines, \nC ++ programs, example datasets and a tutorial is available from\nhttp://moma.ki.au.dk/prj/probfold/\nCONTACT: : jakob.skou@clin.au.dk\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Currently,\nDrop-seq technology requires refinement and quality control (QC) steps are\ncritical for such data analysis. There is a strong need for a convenient and\ncomprehensive approach to obtain dedicated QC and to determine the relationships \nbetween cells for ultra-high-dimensional datasets.\nRESULTS: We developed Dr.seq, a QC and analysis pipeline for Drop-seq data.

We focus on the methylation data from\nIllumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. One of the key issues of\nmethylation analysis is to detect the differential methylation sites between case\nand control groups. Previous approaches describe data with simple summary\nstatistics or kernel function, and then use statistical tests to determine the\ndifference. However, a summary statistics-based approach cannot capture\ncomplicated underlying structure, and a kernel function-based approach lacks\ninterpretability of results.\nRESULTS: We propose a novel method D(3)M, for detection of differential\ndistribution of methylation, based on distribution-valued data. Our method can\ndetect the differences in high-order moments, such as shapes of underlying\ndistributions in methylation profiles, based on the Wasserstein metric. We test\nthe significance of the difference between case and control groups and provide an\ninterpretable summary of the results. The simulation results show that the\nproposed method achieves promising accuracy and shows favorable results compared \nwith previous methods. Glioblastoma multiforme and lower grade glioma data from\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas show that our method supports recent biological advances \nand suggests new insights.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R implemented code is freely available from\nhttps://github.com/ymatts/D3M/ CONTACT: ymatsui@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp or\nshimamura@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Recognizing that gene expressions\nare often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have\ndeveloped a cost-effective strategy of profiling only ∼1000 carefully selected\nlandmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of\nremaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS \nprogram is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since\nit does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes.\nRESULTS: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the\nexpression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the\nmicroarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, consisting of 111K expression\nprofiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other\nmethods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning\nsignificantly outperforms LR with 15.33% relative improvement. A gene-wise\ncomparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in\n99.97% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model\non an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921 expression\nprofiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57% relative improvement, and\nachieves lower error in 81.31% of the target genes.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: D-GEX is available at\nhttps://github.com/uci-cbcl/D-GEX CONTACT: xhx@ics.uci.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

In order to\nunderstand these networks, analysis of differential expression has continuously\nmoved from single genes towards the study of gene sets. Various approaches for\nthe assessment of gene sets have been developed in the context of gene set\nanalysis (GSA). These approaches are bridging the gap between raw measurements\nand semantically meaningful terms.We present a novel approach for assessing\nuncertainty in the definition of gene sets. This is an essential step when new\ngene sets are constructed from domain knowledge or given gene sets are suspected \nto be affected by uncertainty.

There are three types of deletions: blunt deletions, deletions \nwith microhomologies and deletions with microsinsertions. The last two types are \nvery common in the human genome, but they pose difficulty for the detection.\nFurthermore, finding deletions from sequencing data remains challenging. It is\nhighly appealing to develop sensitive and accurate methods to detect deletions\nfrom sequencing data, especially deletions with microhomology and deletions with \nmicroinsertion.\nRESULTS: We present a novel method called Sprites (SPlit Read re-alIgnment To\ndEtect Structural variants) which finds deletions from sequencing data. It aligns\na whole soft-clipping read rather than its clipped part to the target sequence, a\nsegment of the reference which is determined by spanning reads, in order to find \nthe longest prefix or suffix of the read that has a match in the target sequence.\nThis alignment aims to solve the problem of deletions with microhomologies and\ndeletions with microinsertions. Using both simulated and real data we show that\nSprites performs better on detecting deletions compared with other current\nmethods in terms of F-score.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Sprites is open source software and freely\navailable at https://github.com/zhangzhen/sprites\nCONTACT: jxwang@mail.csu.edu.cnSupplementary data: Supplementary data are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Recent efforts in systems biology studies of\ninfectious diseases have resulted in a large collection of datasets measuring\nhost transcriptional response to various pathogens. Computational methods to\nidentify and compare gene expression modules across different infections offer a \npowerful way to identify strain-specific and shared components of the regulatory \nprogram. An important challenge is to identify statistically robust gene\nexpression modules as well as to reliably detect genes that change their module\nmemberships between infections.\nRESULTS: We present MULCCH (MULti-task spectral Consensus Clustering for\nHierarchically related tasks), a consensus extension of a multi-task clustering\nalgorithm to infer high-confidence strain-specific host response modules under\ninfections from multiple virus strains. On simulated data, MULCCH more accurately\nidentifies genes exhibiting pathogen-specific patterns compared to non-consensus \nand nonmulti-task clustering approaches. Application of MULCCH to mammalian\ntranscriptional response to a panel of influenza viruses showed that our method\nidentifies clusters with greater coherence compared to non-consensus methods.\nFurther, MULCCH derived clusters are enriched for several immune system-related\nprocesses and regulators. In summary, MULCCH provides a reliable module-based\napproach to identify molecular pathways and gene sets characterizing commonality \nand specificity of host response to viruses of different pathogenicities.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available at\nhttps://bitbucket.org/roygroup/mulcch\nCONTACT: sroy@biostat.wisc.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Many existing resources contain the chemical properties and\nclassifications of commonly identified metabolites. However, the annotation of\nsmall molecules (both endogenous and synthetic) to meaningful biological pathways\nand concepts still lags behind the analytical capabilities and the\nchemistry-based annotations. Furthermore, no tools are available to visually\nexplore relationships and networks among functionally related groups of\nmetabolites (biomedical concepts). Such a tool would provide the ability to\nestablish testable hypotheses regarding links among metabolic pathways, cellular \nprocesses, phenotypes and diseases.\nRESULTS: Here we present ConceptMetab, an interactive web-based tool for mapping \nand exploring the relationships among 16 069 biologically defined metabolite sets\ndeveloped from Gene Ontology, KEGG and Medical Subject Headings, using both KEGG \nand PubChem compound identifiers, and based on statistical tests for association.\nWe demonstrate the utility of ConceptMetab with multiple scenarios, showing it\ncan be used to identify known and potentially novel relationships among metabolic\npathways, cellular processes, phenotypes and diseases, and provides an intuitive \ninterface for linking compounds to their molecular functions and higher level\nbiological effects.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://conceptmetab.med.umich.edu\nCONTACTS: akarnovsky@umich.edu or sartorma@umich.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Protein design algorithms need to anticipate these backbone changes in\norder to accurately calculate the energy of the structure given an amino acid\nsequence, without knowledge of the final, designed sequence. This is related to\nthe problem of predicting small changes in the backbone between highly similar\nsequences.\nRESULTS: We explored the ability of the Rosetta suite of protein design tools to \nmove the backbone from its position in one structure (template) to its position\nin a close homologous structure (target) as a function of the diversity of a\nbackbone ensemble constructed using the template structure, the percent sequence \nidentity between the template and target, and the size of local zone being\nconsidered in the ensemble. We describe a pareto front in the likelihood of\nmoving the backbone toward the target as a function of ensemble diversity and\nzone size.

To model protein-RNA interactions by\nconsidering all available sources of information, it is necessary to integrate\nthe rapidly growing RBP experimental data with the latest genome annotation, gene\nfunction, RNA sequence and structure. Such integration is possible by matrix\nfactorization, where current approaches have an undesired tendency to identify\nonly a small number of the strongest patterns with overlapping features. Because \nprotein-RNA interactions are orchestrated by multiple factors, methods that\nidentify discriminative patterns of varying strengths are needed.\nRESULTS: We have developed an integrative orthogonality-regularized nonnegative\nmatrix factorization (iONMF) to integrate multiple data sources and discover\nnon-overlapping, class-specific RNA binding patterns of varying strengths. The\northogonality constraint halves the effective size of the factor model and\noutperforms other NMF models in predicting RBP interaction sites on RNA. We have \nintegrated the largest data compendium to date, which includes 31 CLIP\nexperiments on 19 RBPs involved in splicing (such as hnRNPs, U2AF2, ELAVL1,\nTDP-43 and FUS) and processing of 3'UTR (Ago, IGF2BP). We show that the\nintegration of multiple data sources improves the predictive accuracy of\nretrieval of RNA binding sites. In our study the key predictive factors of\nprotein-RNA interactions were the position of RNA structure and sequence motifs, \nRBP co-binding and gene region type. We report on a number of protein-specific\npatterns, many of which are consistent with experimentally determined properties \nof RBPs.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The iONMF implementation and example datasets\nare available at https://github.com/mstrazar/ionmf\nCONTACT: : tomaz.curk@fri.uni-lj.si\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Building on\npreviously published work with the single sample SNV caller genotype model\nselection (GeMS), a multiple sample version of GeMS (MultiGeMS) is introduced.\nUnlike other popular multiple sample SNV callers, the MultiGeMS statistical model\naccounts for enzymatic substitution sequencing errors. It also addresses the\nmultiple testing problem endemic to multiple sample SNV calling and utilizes high\nperformance computing (HPC) techniques.\nRESULTS: A simulation study demonstrates that MultiGeMS ranks highest in\nprecision among a selection of popular multiple sample SNV callers, while showing\nexceptional recall in calling common SNVs. Further, both simulation studies and\nreal data analyses indicate that MultiGeMS is robust to low-quality data.

This is achieved mainly by sequence-specific binding to 3'\nuntranslated regions of target mRNA. The result is post-transcriptional\ninterference in gene expression which reduces protein levels either by promoting \ndestabilisation of mRNA or translational repression. Research published since\n2010 shows that microRNAs are important regulators of gene expression in\nepilepsy. A series of microRNA profiling studies in rodent and human tissue has\nrevealed that epilepsy is associated with wide ranging changes to microRNA levels\nin the brain. These are thought to influence processes including cell death,\ninflammation and re-wiring of neuronal networks. MicroRNAs have also been\nidentified in the blood after injury to the brain and therefore may serve as\nbiomarkers of epilepsy. EpimiRBase is a manually curated database for researchers\ninterested in the role of microRNAs in epilepsy. The fully searchable database\nincludes information on up- and down-regulated microRNAs in the brain and blood, \nas well as functional studies, and covers both rodent models and human\nepilepsy.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: EpimiRBase is available at\nhttp://www.epimirbase.eu\nCONTACT: catherinemooney@rcsi.ie.\n\n© The Author 2016.

One major challenge in\nmiRNA studies is the identification of genes targeted by miRNAs. Currently, most \nresearchers rely on computational programs to initially identify target\ncandidates for subsequent validation. Although considerable progress has been\nmade in recent years for computational target prediction, there is still\nsignificant room for algorithmic improvement.\nRESULTS: Here, we present an improved target prediction algorithm, which was\ndeveloped by modeling high-throughput profiling data from recent CLIPL\n(crosslinking and immunoprecipitation followed by RNA ligation) sequencing\nstudies. In these CLIPL-seq studies, the RNA sequences in each miRNA-target pair \nwere covalently linked and unambiguously determined experimentally. By analyzing \nthe CLIPL data, many known and novel features relevant to target recognition were\nidentified and then used to build a computational model for target prediction.\nComparative analysis showed that the new algorithm had improved performance over \nexisting algorithms when applied to independent experimental data.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All the target prediction data as well as the\nprediction tool can be accessed at miRDB (http://mirdb.org).\nCONTACT: xwang@radonc.wustl.edu.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Analyses of these data require new statistical and\ncomputational methods. In this article, we propose one such method that is useful\nin selecting explanatory variables for prediction of a binary response. Although \nthis problem has recently been addressed using penalized likelihood methods, we\nadopt a Bayesian approach that utilizes a mixture of non-local prior densities\nand point masses on the binary regression coefficient vectors.\nRESULTS: The resulting method, which we call iMOMLogit, provides improved\nperformance in identifying true models and reducing estimation and prediction\nerror in a number of simulation studies. More importantly, its application to\nseveral genomic datasets produces predictions that have high accuracy using far\nfewer explanatory variables than competing methods. We also describe a novel\napproach for setting prior hyperparameters by examining the total variation\ndistance between the prior distributions on the regression parameters and the\ndistribution of the maximum likelihood estimator under the null distribution.\nFinally, we describe a computational algorithm that can be used to implement\niMOMLogit in ultrahigh-dimensional settings ([Formula: see text]) and provide\ndiagnostics to assess the probability that this algorithm has identified the\nhighest posterior probability model.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Software to implement this method can be\ndownloaded at: http://www.stat.tamu.edu/∼amir/code.html\nCONTACT: wwang7@mdanderson.org or vjohnson@stat.tamu.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

So far, none of these methods has combined information \nabout abnormally mapped read pairs connecting rearranged regions and associated\nglobal copy number changes automatically inferred from the same sequencing data\nfile. Our aim was to create a computational method that could use both types of\ninformation, i.e. normal and abnormal reads, and demonstrate that by doing so we \ncan highly improve both sensitivity and specificity rates of structural variant\nprediction.\nRESULTS: We developed a computational method, SV-Bay, to detect structural\nvariants from whole genome sequencing mate-pair or paired-end data using a\nprobabilistic Bayesian approach. This approach takes into account depth of\ncoverage by normal reads and abnormalities in read pair mappings. To estimate the\nmodel likelihood, SV-Bay considers GC-content and read mappability of the genome,\nthus making important corrections to the expected read count. For the detection\nof somatic variants, SV-Bay makes use of a matched normal sample when it is\navailable. We validated SV-Bay on simulated datasets and an experimental\nmate-pair dataset for the CLB-GA neuroblastoma cell line. The comparison of\nSV-Bay with several other methods for structural variant detection demonstrated\nthat SV-Bay has better prediction accuracy both in terms of sensitivity and\nfalse-positive detection rate.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/InstitutCurie/SV-Bay\nCONTACT: valentina.boeva@inserm.fr\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

One effect that is caused\nby alignments with missing per-gene or per-partition sequences is that the\ninferred phylogenies may exhibit extremely long branch lengths. We investigate if\nstatistically predicting missing sequences for organisms by using information\nfrom genes/partitions that have data for these organisms alleviates the problem\nand improves phylogenetic accuracy.\nRESULTS: We present several algorithms for correcting excessively long branch\nlengths induced by missing data. We also present methods for predicting/imputing \nmissing sequence data. We evaluate our algorithms by systematically removing\nsequence data from three empirical and 100 simulated alignments. We then compare \nthe Maximum Likelihood trees inferred from the gappy alignments and on the\nalignments with predicted sequence data to the trees inferred from the original, \ncomplete datasets. The datasets with predicted sequences showed one to two orders\nof magnitude more accurate branch lengths compared to the branch lengths of the\ntrees inferred from the alignments with missing data. However, prediction did not\naffect the RF distances between the trees.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/ddarriba/ForeSeqs\nCONTACT: : diego.darriba@h-its.org\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Several existing methods perform comparisons between proteins based\non the semantic similarity of their GO terms; however, these measures are highly \nsensitive to modifications in the topological structure of GO, tend to be focused\non specific analytical tasks and concentrate on the GO terms themselves rather\nthan considering their textual definitions.\nRESULTS: We introduce simDEF, an efficient method for measuring semantic\nsimilarity of GO terms using their GO definitions, which is based on the Gloss\nVector measure commonly used in natural language processing. The simDEF approach \nbuilds optimized definition vectors for all relevant GO terms, and expresses the \nsimilarity of a pair of proteins as the cosine of the angle between their\ndefinition vectors. Relative to existing similarity measures, when validated on a\nyeast reference database, simDEF improves correlation with sequence homology by\nup to 50%, shows a correlation improvement >4% with gene expression in the\nbiological process hierarchy of GO and increases PPI predictability by > 2.5% in \nF1 score for molecular function hierarchy.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Datasets, results and source code are available \nat http://kiwi.cs.dal.ca/Software/simDEF CONTACT: ahmad.pgh@dal.ca or\nbeiko@cs.dal.ca\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

A \ncis-regulatory module (CRM) is a genomic locus that is responsible for gene\nregulation and that contains multiple transcription factor binding sites in close\nproximity. Given a collection of known transcription factor binding motifs, many \nbioinformatics methods have been proposed over the past 15 years for identifying \nwithin a genomic sequence candidate CRMs consisting of clusters of those\nmotifs.RESULTS: The MCAST algorithm uses a hidden Markov model with a\nP-value-based scoring scheme to identify candidate CRMs. Here, we introduce a new\nversion of MCAST that offers improved graphical output, a dynamic background\nmodel, statistical confidence estimates based on false discovery rate estimation \nand, most significantly, the ability to predict CRMs while taking into account\nepigenomic data such as DNase I sensitivity or histone modification data. We\ndemonstrate the validity of MCAST's statistical confidence estimates and the\nutility of epigenomic priors in identifying CRMs.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MCAST is part of the MEME Suite software\ntoolkit.

Mechanistic dynamic models of biochemical\nnetworks are frequently based on nonlinear differential equation systems and\nfeature a large number of parameters, sparse observations of the model components\nand lack of information in the available data. Due to the curse of\ndimensionality, classical and sampling approaches propagating parameter\nuncertainties to predictions are hardly feasible and insufficient. However, for\nexperimental design and to discriminate between competing models, prediction and \nconfidence bands are essential. To circumvent the hurdles of the former methods, \nan approach to calculate a profile likelihood on arbitrary observations for a\nspecific time point has been introduced, which provides accurate confidence and\nprediction intervals for nonlinear models and is computationally feasible for\nhigh-dimensional models.\nRESULTS: In this article, reliable and smooth point-wise prediction and\nconfidence bands to assess the model's uncertainty on the whole time-course are\nachieved via explicit integration with elaborate correction mechanisms. The\ncorresponding system of ordinary differential equations is derived and tested on \nthree established models for cellular signalling.

Our package includes a single-cell specific noise model allowing for\nmissing and censored values. In contrast to previous implementations, we further \npresent an efficient nearest-neighbour approximation that allows for the\nprocessing of hundreds of thousands of cells and a functionality for projecting\nnew data on existing diffusion maps. We exemplarily apply destiny to a recent\ntime-resolved mass cytometry dataset of cellular reprogramming.AVAILABILITY AND\nIMPLEMENTATION: destiny is an open-source R/Bioconductor package\n\"bioconductor.org/packages/destiny\" also available at\nwww.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/destiny A detailed vignette describing functions\nand workflows is provided with the package.\nCONTACT: carsten.marr@helmholtz-muenchen.de or f.buettner@helmholtz-muenchen.de\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

For identical results to be achieved, regularly updated reference\nsequence databases must be versioned and archived. Database administrators have\ntried to fill the requirements by supplying users with one-off versions of\ndatabases, but these are time consuming to set up and are inconsistent across\nresources. Disk storage and data backup performance has also discouraged\nmaintaining multiple versions of databases since databases such as NCBI nr can\nconsume 50 Gb or more disk space per version, with growth rates that parallel\nMoore's law.\nRESULTS: Our end-to-end solution combines our own Kipper software package-a\nsimple key-value large file versioning system-with BioMAJ (software for\ndownloading sequence databases), and Galaxy (a web-based bioinformatics data\nprocessing platform). Available versions of databases can be recalled and used by\ncommand-line and Galaxy users. The Kipper data store format makes publishing\ncurated FASTA databases convenient since in most cases it can store a range of\nversions into a file marginally larger than the size of the latest version.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Kipper v1.0.0 and the Galaxy Versioned Data tool\nare written in Python and released as free and open source software available at \nhttps://github.com/Public-Health-Bioinformatics/kipper and\nhttps://github.com/Public-Health-Bioinformatics/versioned_data, respectively;\ndetailed setup instructions can be found at\nhttps://github.com/Public-Health-Bioinformatics/versioned_data/blob/master/doc/se\ntup.md\nCONTACT: : Damion.Dooley@Bccdc.Ca or William.Hsiao@Bccdc.CaSupplementary\ninformation: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2015.

However, automatic GO maintenance remains to be\ndifficult because of the complex logical reasoning and the need of biological\nknowledge that are not explicitly represented in the GO. The existing studies\neither construct whole GO based on network data or only infer the relations\nbetween existing GO terms. None is purposed to add new terms automatically to the\nexisting GO.\nRESULTS: We proposed a new algorithm 'GOExtender' to efficiently identify all the\nconnected gene pairs labeled by the same parent GO terms. GOExtender is used to\npredict new GO terms with biological network data, and connect them to the\nexisting GO. Evaluation tests on biological process and cellular component\ncategories of different GO releases showed that GOExtender can extend new GO\nterms automatically based on the biological network. Furthermore, we applied\nGOExtender to the recent release of GO and discovered new GO terms with strong\nsupport from literature.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Software and supplementary document are\navailable at www.msu.edu/%7Ejinchen/GOExtender\nCONTACT: jinchen@msu.edu or ydwang@hit.edu.cn\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

However, due to the inherent complexity\nof phosphorylation patterns and the lack of knowledge on how phosphorylations are\nrelated to functions, it is often not possible to directly deduce protein\nactivities from those measurements. Here, we present a heuristic machine learning\nalgorithm that infers the activities of kinases from Phosphoproteomics data using\nkinase-target information from the PhosphoSitePlus database. By comparing the\nestimated kinase activity profiles to the measured phosphosite profiles, it is\nfurthermore possible to derive the kinases that are most likely to phosphorylate \nthe respective phosphosite.\nRESULTS: We apply our approach to published datasets of the human cell cycle\ngenerated from HeLaS3 cells, and insulin signalling dynamics in mouse\nhepatocytes. In the first case, we estimate the activities of 118 at six cell\ncycle stages and derive 94 new kinase-phosphosite links that can be validated\nthrough either database or motif information. In the second case, the activities \nof 143 kinases at eight time points are estimated and 49 new kinase-target links \nare derived.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The algorithm is implemented in Matlab and be\ndownloaded from github.

(2)Department of \nComputational Medicine and Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Department,\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.\n\nTests for differential gene expression with RNA-seq data have a tendency to\nidentify certain types of transcripts as significant, e.g. longer and\nhighly-expressed transcripts. This tendency has been shown to bias gene set\nenrichment (GSE) testing, which is used to find over- or under-represented\nbiological functions in the data. Yet, there remains a surprising lack of tools\nfor GSE testing specific for RNA-seq. We present a new GSE method for RNA-seq\ndata, RNA-Enrich, that accounts for the above tendency empirically by adjusting\nfor average read count per gene. RNA-Enrich is a quick, flexible method and\nweb-based tool, with 16 available gene annotation databases. It does not require \na P-value cut-off to define differential expression, and works well even with\nsmall sample-sized experiments. We show that adjusting for read counts per gene\nimproves both the type I error rate and detection power of the test.AVAILABILITY \nAND IMPLEMENTATION: RNA-Enrich is available at http://lrpath.ncibi.org or from\nsupplemental material as R code.\nCONTACT: sartorma@umich.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

The secondary structure of protein-coding sequences (CDSs) is one\npotential factor that could have both positive and negative effects on protein\nproduction. To elucidate the role of secondary structure in CDSs, algorithms for \nmanipulating secondary structure should be developed.\nRESULTS: We developed an algorithm for designing a CDS with the most stable\nsecondary structure among all possible ones translated into the same protein, and\nimplemented it as the program CDSfold. The algorithm runs the Zuker algorithm\nunder the constraint of a given amino acid sequence. The time and space\ncomplexity is O(L(3)) and O(L(2)), respectively, where L is the length of the CDS\nto be designed. Although our algorithm is slower than the original Zuker\nalgorithm, it could design a relatively long (2.7-kb) CDS in approximately 1 h.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The CDSfold program is freely available for\nnon-commercial users as stand-alone and web-based software from\nhttp://cdsfold.trahed.jp/cdsfold/\nCONTACTS: terai-goro@aist.go.jp or asai@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Both\ntheoretical arguments and simulation experiments indicate, however, that model\nposterior probabilities may be poorly evaluated by standard ABC techniques.\nRESULTS: We propose a novel approach based on a machine learning tool named\nrandom forests (RF) to conduct selection among the highly complex models covered \nby ABC algorithms. We thus modify the way Bayesian model selection is both\nunderstood and operated, in that we rephrase the inferential goal as a\nclassification problem, first predicting the model that best fits the data with\nRF and postponing the approximation of the posterior probability of the selected \nmodel for a second stage also relying on RF. Compared with earlier\nimplementations of ABC model choice, the ABC RF approach offers several potential\nimprovements: (i) it often has a larger discriminative power among the competing \nmodels, (ii) it is more robust against the number and choice of statistics\nsummarizing the data, (iii) the computing effort is drastically reduced (with a\ngain in computation efficiency of at least 50) and (iv) it includes an\napproximation of the posterior probability of the selected model. The call to RF \nwill undoubtedly extend the range of size of datasets and complexity of models\nthat ABC can handle. We illustrate the power of this novel methodology by\nanalyzing controlled experiments as well as genuine population genetics datasets.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The proposed methodology is implemented in the R\npackage abcrf available on the CRAN.\nCONTACT: jean-michel.marin@umontpellier.fr\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

To date, Nested Effect Models\ncannot resolve signalling details like the formation of signalling complexes or\nthe activation of proteins by multiple alternative input signals. Here we\nintroduce Boolean Nested Effect Models (B-NEM). B-NEMs combine the use of\ndownstream effects with the higher resolution of signalling pathway structures in\nBoolean Networks.\nRESULTS: We show that B-NEMs accurately reconstruct signal flows in simulated\ndata. Using B-NEM we then resolve BCR signalling via PI3K and TAK1 kinases in BL2\nlymphoma cell lines.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R code is available at\nhttps://github.com/MartinFXP/B-NEM (github). The BCR signalling dataset is\navailable at the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) through\naccession number GSE68761.\nCONTACT: martin-franz-xaver.pirkl@ukr.de, Rainer.Spang@ukr.de\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Epub\n2015 Nov 16.\n\nPrioritizing hypothesis tests for high throughput data.\n\nKim S(1), Schliekelman P(1).\n\nAuthor information: \n(1)Department of Statistics, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA.\n\nMOTIVATION: The advent of high throughput data has led to a massive increase in\nthe number of hypothesis tests conducted in many types of biological studies and \na concomitant increase in stringency of significance thresholds. Filtering\nmethods, which use independent information to eliminate less promising tests and \nthus reduce multiple testing, have been widely and successfully applied. However,\nkey questions remain about how to best apply them: When is filtering beneficial\nand when is it detrimental? How good does the independent information need to be \nin order for filtering to be effective? How should one choose the filter cutoff\nthat separates tests that pass the filter from those that don't?\nRESULT: We quantify the effect of the quality of the filter information, the\nfilter cutoff and other factors on the effectiveness of the filter and show a\nnumber of results: If the filter has a high probability (e.g. 70%) of ranking\ntrue positive features highly (e.g. top 10%), then filtering can lead to dramatic\nincrease (e.g. 10-fold) in discovery probability when there is high redundancy in\ninformation between hypothesis tests. Filtering is less effective when there is\nlow redundancy between hypothesis tests and its benefit decreases rapidly as the \nquality of the filter information decreases. Furthermore, the outcome is highly\ndependent on the choice of filter cutoff. Choosing the cutoff without reference\nto the data will often lead to a large loss in discovery probability. However,\nnaïve optimization of the cutoff using the data will lead to inflated type I\nerror. We introduce a data-based method for choosing the cutoff that maintains\ncontrol of the family-wise error rate via a correction factor to the significance\nthreshold. Application of this approach offers as much as a several-fold\nadvantage in discovery probability relative to no filtering, while maintaining\ntype I error control. We also introduce a closely related method of P-value\nweighting that further improves performance.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: R code for calculating the correction factor is \navailable at http://www.stat.uga.edu/people/faculty/paul-schliekelman\nCONTACT: pdschlie@stat.uga.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

(4)School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston\nUniversity, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, B4 7ET, UK.\n\nMOTIVATION: In any macromolecular polyprotic system-for example protein, DNA or\nRNA-the isoelectric point-commonly referred to as the pI-can be defined as the\npoint of singularity in a titration curve, corresponding to the solution pH value\nat which the net overall surface charge-and thus the electrophoretic mobility-of \nthe ampholyte sums to zero. Different modern analytical biochemistry and\nproteomics methods depend on the isoelectric point as a principal feature for\nprotein and peptide characterization. Protein separation by isoelectric point is \na critical part of 2-D gel electrophoresis, a key precursor of proteomics, where \ndiscrete spots can be digested in-gel, and proteins subsequently identified by\nanalytical mass spectrometry. Peptide fractionation according to their pI is also\nwidely used in current proteomics sample preparation procedures previous to the\nLC-MS/MS analysis. Therefore accurate theoretical prediction of pI would expedite\nsuch analysis. While such pI calculation is widely used, it remains largely\nuntested, motivating our efforts to benchmark pI prediction methods.\nRESULTS: Using data from the database PIP-DB and one publically available dataset\nas our reference gold standard, we have undertaken the benchmarking of pI\ncalculation methods. We find that methods vary in their accuracy and are highly\nsensitive to the choice of basis set. The machine-learning algorithms, especially\nthe SVM-based algorithm, showed a superior performance when studying peptide\nmixtures. In general, learning-based pI prediction methods (such as Cofactor, SVM\nand Branca) require a large training dataset and their resulting performance will\nstrongly depend of the quality of that data. In contrast with Iterative methods, \nmachine-learning algorithms have the advantage of being able to add new features \nto improve the accuracy of prediction.\nCONTACT: yperez@ebi.ac.uk\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software and data are freely available at\nhttps://github.com/ypriverol/pIRSupplementary information: Supplementary data are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Modern seed-and-extend mappers usually select seeds with\neither an equal and fixed-length scheme or with an inflexible placement scheme,\nboth of which limit the ability of the mapper in selecting less frequent seeds to\nspeed up the mapping process. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a new algorithm\nthat can adjust both the individual seed length and the seed placement, as well\nas derive less frequent seeds.\nRESULTS: We present the Optimal Seed Solver (OSS), a dynamic programming\nalgorithm that discovers the least frequently-occurring set of x seeds in an\nL-base-pair read in [Formula: see text] operations on average and in [Formula:\nsee text] operations in the worst case, while generating a maximum of [Formula:\nsee text] seed frequency database lookups. We compare OSS against four\nstate-of-the-art seed selection schemes and observe that OSS provides a 3-fold\nreduction in average seed frequency over the best previous seed selection\noptimizations.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We provide an implementation of the Optimal Seed\nSolver in C++ at: https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Optimal-Seed-Solver\nCONTACT: hxin@cmu.edu, calkan@cs.bilkent.edu.tr or onur@cmu.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

The task is to design a work flow with a minimal set of tools that\nwould reach state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of species.\nGeneMark-ET is a gene prediction tool that incorporates RNA-Seq data into\nunsupervised training and subsequently generates ab initio gene predictions.\nAUGUSTUS is a gene finder that usually requires supervised training and uses\ninformation from RNA-Seq reads in the prediction step. Complementary strengths of\nGeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS provided motivation for designing a new combined tool\nfor automatic gene prediction.\nRESULTS: We present BRAKER1, a pipeline for unsupervised RNA-Seq-based genome\nannotation that combines the advantages of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS. As input,\nBRAKER1 requires a genome assembly file and a file in bam-format with spliced\nalignments of RNA-Seq reads to the genome. First, GeneMark-ET performs iterative \ntraining and generates initial gene structures. Second, AUGUSTUS uses predicted\ngenes for training and then integrates RNA-Seq read information into final gene\npredictions. In our experiments, we observed that BRAKER1 was more accurate than \nMAKER2 when it is using RNA-Seq as sole source for training and prediction.\nBRAKER1 does not require pre-trained parameters or a separate expert-prepared\ntraining step.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BRAKER1 is available for download at\nhttp://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/braker/ and\nhttp://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark/\nCONTACT: katharina.hoff@uni-greifswald.de or borodovsky@gatech.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

However, in a\ntypical high-throughput experiment, only limited number of samples were assayed, \nthus the classical 'large p, small n' problem. On the other hand, rapid\npropagation of these high-throughput technologies has resulted in a substantial\ncollection of data, often carried out on the same platform and using the same\nprotocol. It is highly desirable to utilize the existing data when performing\nanalysis and inference on a new dataset.\nRESULTS: Utilizing existing data can be carried out in a straightforward fashion \nunder the Bayesian framework in which the repository of historical data can be\nexploited to build informative priors and used in new data analysis. In this\nwork, using microarray data, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of \nderiving informative priors from historical data and using them in the problem of\ndetecting differentially expressed genes. Through simulation and real data\nanalysis, we show that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms existing\nmethods including the popular and state-of-the-art Bayesian hierarchical\nmodel-based approaches. Our work illustrates the feasibility and benefits of\nexploiting the increasingly available genomics big data in statistical inference \nand presents a promising practical strategy for dealing with the 'large p, small \nn' problem.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our method is implemented in R package IPBT,\nwhich is freely available from https://github.com/benliemory/IPBT CONTACT:\nyuzhu@purdue.edu; zhaohui.qin@emory.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

In this work, we focus on RNA-seq gene\nexpression analysis and specifically on case-control studies with rule-based\nsupervised classification algorithms that build a model able to discriminate\ncases from controls. State of the art algorithms compute a single classification \nmodel that contains few features (genes). On the contrary, our goal is to elicit \na higher amount of knowledge by computing many classification models, and\ntherefore to identify most of the genes related to the predicted class.\nRESULTS: We propose CAMUR, a new method that extracts multiple and equivalent\nclassification models. CAMUR iteratively computes a rule-based classification\nmodel, calculates the power set of the genes present in the rules, iteratively\neliminates those combinations from the data set, and performs again the\nclassification procedure until a stopping criterion is verified. CAMUR includes\nan ad-hoc knowledge repository (database) and a querying tool.We analyze three\ndifferent types of RNA-seq data sets (Breast, Head and Neck, and Stomach Cancer) \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and we validate CAMUR and its models also on \nnon-TCGA data. Our experimental results show the efficacy of CAMUR: we obtain\nseveral reliable equivalent classification models, from which the most frequent\ngenes, their relationships, and the relation with a particular cancer are\ndeduced.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: dmb.iasi.cnr.it/camur.php\nCONTACT: emanuel@iasi.cnr.it\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

One such receptor is the MHC class I molecule.\nThe length preferences vary depending on the MHC allele, but are generally\nlimited to peptides of length 8-11 amino acids.

Also, we illustrate how the location of\ndeletions can aid the interpretation of the modes of binding of the peptide-MHC, \nas in the case of long peptides bulging out of the MHC groove or protruding at\neither terminus.

In particular, some nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures are of \nlower quality than X-ray crystallographic structures. Here, we present NMRe, a\nweb-based server for NMR structure refinement. The previously developed\nknowledge-based energy function STAP (Statistical Torsion Angle Potential) was\nused for NMRe refinement. With STAP, NMRe provides two refinement protocols using\ntwo types of distance restraints.

Additionally, NMRe generates NOE-like\ndistance restraints based on the inter-hydrogen distances derived from the input \nstructure. The efficiency of NMRe refinement was validated on 20 NMR structures. \nMost of the quality assessment scores of the refined NMR structures were better\nthan those of the original structures.

Protein-Drug Interaction Database (PDID) addresses incompleteness of \nthese data by providing access to putative protein-drug interactions that cover\nthe entire structural human proteome.\nRESULTS: PDID covers 9652 structures from 3746 proteins and houses 16 800\nputative interactions generated from close to 1.1 million accurate, all-atom\nstructure-based predictions for several dozens of popular drugs. The predictions \nwere generated with three modern methods: ILbind, SMAP and eFindSite. They are\naccompanied by propensity scores that quantify likelihood of interactions and\ncoordinates of the putative location of the binding drugs in the corresponding\nprotein structures. PDID complements the current databases that focus on the\ncurated interactions and the BioDrugScreen database that relies on docking to\nfind putative interactions. Moreover, we also include experimentally curated\ninteractions which are linked to their sources: DrugBank, BindingDB and Protein\nData Bank. Our database can be used to facilitate studies related to\npolypharmacology of drugs including repurposing and explaining side effects of\ndrugs.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PDID database is freely available at\nhttp://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/PDID/.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Of particular\ninterest are the so-called ': hotspots ': , important genetic variants that\nregulate the expression of many genes. Recently, attention has focussed on\nwhether eQTLs are common to several tissues, cell-types or, more generally,\nconditions or whether they are specific to a particular condition.\nRESULTS: We have implemented MT-HESS, a Bayesian hierarchical model that analyses\nthe association between a large set of predictors, e.g. SNPs, and many responses,\ne.g. gene expression, in multiple tissues, cells or conditions. Our Bayesian\nsparse regression algorithm goes beyond ': one-at-a-time ': association tests\nbetween SNPs and responses and uses a fully multivariate model search across all \nlinear combinations of SNPs, coupled with a model of the correlation between\ncondition/tissue-specific responses. In addition, we use a hierarchical structure\nto leverage shared information across different genes, thus improving the\ndetection of hotspots. We show the increase of power resulting from our new\napproach in an extensive simulation study. Our analysis of two case studies\nhighlights new hotspots that would remain undetected by standard approaches and\nshows how greater prediction power can be achieved when several tissues are\njointly considered.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: C[Formula: see text] source code and\ndocumentation including compilation instructions are available under GNU licence \nat http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/.\n\n© The Author 2015.

However, almost all the decoy sets currently used in literature\nsuffer from uneven root mean square deviation (RMSD) distribution with bias to\nnon-protein like hydrogen-bonding and compactness patterns. Meanwhile, most\nprotein decoy sets are pre-calculated and there is a lack of methods for\nautomated generation of high-quality decoys for any target proteins.\nRESULTS: We developed a new algorithm, 3DRobot, to create protein structure\ndecoys by free fragment assembly with enhanced hydrogen-bonding and compactness\ninteractions. The method was benchmarked with three widely used decoy sets from\nab initio folding and comparative modeling simulations. The decoys generated by\n3DRobot are shown to have significantly enhanced diversity and evenness with a\ncontinuous distribution in the RMSD space. The new energy terms introduced in\n3DRobot improve the hydrogen-bonding network and compactness of decoys, which\neliminates the possibility of native structure recognition by trivial potentials.\nAlgorithms that can automatically create such diverse and well-packed non-native \nconformations from any protein structure should have a broad impact on the\ndevelopment of advanced protein force field and folding simulation methods.\nAVAILIABLITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/3DRobot/\nCONTACT: jiay@phy.ccnu.edu.cn; zhng@umich.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Functional profiling has valuable applications in biological\nresearch because it identifies the abundances of the functional genes of the\norganisms present in the original sample, answering the question what they can\ndo. Currently, available tools do not scale well with increasing data volumes,\nwhich is important because both the number and lengths of the reads produced by\nsequencing platforms keep increasing. Here, we introduce SUPER-FOCUS, SUbsystems \nProfile by databasE Reduction using FOCUS, an agile homology-based approach using\na reduced reference database to report the subsystems present in metagenomic\ndatasets and profile their abundances. SUPER-FOCUS was tested with over 70 real\nmetagenomes, the results showing that it accurately predicts the subsystems\npresent in the profiled microbial communities, and is up to 1000 times faster\nthan other tools.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SUPER-FOCUS was implemented in Python, and its\nsource code and the tool website are freely available at\nhttps://edwards.sdsu.edu/SUPERFOCUS.\nCONTACT: redwards@mail.sdsu.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

However, the existing threading tools perform poorly on remote\nhomologous proteins. Thus, improving fold recognition for remote homologous\nproteins remains a challenge. Besides, the proteome-wide structure prediction\nposes another challenge of increasing prediction throughput. In this study, we\npresented FALCON@home as a protein structure prediction server focusing on remote\nhomologue identification. The design of FALCON@home is based on the observation\nthat a structural template, especially for remote homologous proteins, consists\nof conserved regions interweaved with highly variable regions. The highly\nvariable regions lead to vague alignments in threading approaches. Thus,\nFALCON@home first extracts conserved regions from each template and then aligns a\nquery protein with conserved regions only rather than the full-length template\ndirectly. This helps avoid the vague alignments rooted in highly variable\nregions, improving remote homologue identification. We implemented FALCON@home\nusing the Berkeley Open Infrastructure of Network Computing (BOINC) volunteer\ncomputing protocol. With computation power donated from over 20,000 volunteer\nCPUs, FALCON@home shows a throughput as high as processing of over 1000 proteins \nper day. In the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP11), the\nFALCON@home-based prediction was ranked the 12th in the template-based modeling\ncategory. As an application, the structures of 880 mouse mitochondria proteins\nwere predicted, which revealed the significant correlation between protein\nhalf-lives and protein structural factors.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: FALCON@home is freely available at\nhttp://protein.ict.ac.cn/FALCON/.\nCONTACT: shuaicli@cityu.edu.hk, dbu@ict.ac.cn\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

To model and understand these processes, it is necessary to go\nbeyond ground state structures. The study of rugged RNA folding landscapes holds \nthe key to answer these questions. Efficient coarse-graining methods are required\nto reduce the intractably vast energy landscapes into condensed representations\nsuch as barrier trees or basin hopping graphs : BHG) that convey an approximate\nbut comprehensive picture of the folding kinetics. So far, exact and heuristic\ncoarse-graining methods have been mostly restricted to the pseudoknot-free\nsecondary structures. Pseudoknots, which are common motifs and have been\nrepeatedly hypothesized to play an important role in guiding folding\ntrajectories, were usually excluded.\nRESULTS: We generalize the BHG framework to include pseudoknotted RNA structures \nand systematically study the differences in predicted folding behavior depending \non whether pseudoknotted structures are allowed to occur as folding intermediates\nor not. We observe that RNAs with pseudoknotted ground state structures tend to\nhave more pseudoknotted folding intermediates than RNAs with pseudoknot-free\nground state structures. The occurrence and influence of pseudoknotted\nintermediates on the folding pathway, however, appear to depend very strongly on \nthe individual RNAs so that no general rule can be inferred.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The algorithms described here are implemented in\nC++ as standalone programs.

The coefficient of variation for peaks \ndetected in replicate injections of a complex Escherichia Coli extract were\nhalved (a reduction of 19%).

Such annotations are valuable for antibody sequence comparison,\nprotein structure modelling and engineering. Multiple different numbering schemes\nexist, they vary in the nomenclature they use to annotate residue positions,\ntheir definitions of position equivalence and their popularity within different\nscientific disciplines.

Our approach\nresults in order of magnitude improvements compared with bigWig and ensures\ncompression rates only a fraction of those produced by cWig. The key features of \nthe smallWig algorithm are statistical data analysis and a combination of source \ncoding methods that ensure high flexibility and make the algorithm suitable for\ndifferent applications. Furthermore, for general-purpose file compression, the\ncompression rate of smallWig approaches the empirical entropy of the tested WIG\ndata. For compression with random query features, smallWig uses a simple\nblock-based compression scheme that introduces only a minor overhead in the\ncompression rate. For archival or storage space-sensitive applications, the\nmethod relies on context mixing techniques that lead to further improvements of\nthe compression rate. Implementations of smallWig can be executed in parallel on \ndifferent sets of chromosomes using multiple processors, thereby enabling\ndesirable scaling for future transcriptome Big Data platforms.\nMOTIVATION: The development of next-generation sequencing technologies has led to\na dramatic decrease in the cost of DNA/RNA sequencing and expression profiling.\nRNA-seq has emerged as an important and inexpensive technology that provides\ninformation about whole transcriptomes of various species and organisms, as well \nas different organs and cellular communities. The vast volume of data generated\nby RNA-seq experiments has significantly increased data storage costs and\ncommunication bandwidth requirements. Current compression tools for RNA-seq data \nsuch as bigWig and cWig either use general-purpose compressors (gzip) or\nsuboptimal compression schemes that leave significant room for improvement. To\nsubstantiate this claim, we performed a statistical analysis of expression data\nin different transform domains and developed accompanying entropy coding methods \nthat bridge the gap between theoretical and practical WIG file compression rates.\nRESULTS: We tested different variants of the smallWig compression algorithm on a \nnumber of integer-and real- (floating point) valued RNA-seq WIG files generated\nby the ENCODE project. The results reveal that, on average, smallWig offers\n18-fold compression rate improvements, up to 2.5-fold compression time\nimprovements, and 1.5-fold decompression time improvements when compared with\nbigWig. On the tested files, the memory usage of the algorithm never exceeded 90 \nKB. When more elaborate context mixing compressors were used within smallWig, the\nobtained compression rates were as much as 23 times better than those of bigWig. \nFor smallWig used in the random query mode, which also supports retrieval of the \nsummary statistics, an overhead in the compression rate of roughly 3-17% was\nintroduced depending on the chosen system parameters. An increase in encoding and\ndecoding time of 30% and 55% represents an additional performance loss caused by \nenabling random data access. We also implemented smallWig using multi-processor\nprogramming. This parallelization feature decreases the encoding delay 2-3.4\ntimes compared with that of a single-processor implementation, with the number of\nprocessors used ranging from 2 to 8; in the same parameter regime, the decoding\ndelay decreased 2-5.2 times.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The smallWig software can be downloaded from:\nhttp://stanford.edu/~zhiyingw/smallWig/smallwig.html,\nhttp://publish.illinois.edu/milenkovic/, http://web.stanford.edu/~tsachy/.\nCONTACT: zhiyingw@stanford.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

It is\nbecoming apparent that many different types of interactions can be potential drug\ntargets. Compared with inhibition of a single protein, inhibition of\nprotein-protein interaction (PPI) is promising to improve the specificity with\nfewer adverse side-effects. Also it greatly broadens the drug target search\nspace, which makes the drug target discovery difficult. Computational methods are\nhighly desired to efficiently provide candidates for further experiments and hold\nthe promise to greatly accelerate the discovery of novel drug targets.\nRESULTS: Here, we propose a machine learning method to predict PPI targets in a\ngenomic-wide scale. Specifically, we develop a computational method, named as\nPrePPItar, to Predict PPIs as drug targets by uncovering the potential\nassociations between drugs and PPIs. First, we survey the databases and manually \nconstruct a gold-standard positive dataset for drug and PPI interactions. This\neffort leads to a dataset with 227 associations among 63 PPIs and 113\nFDA-approved drugs and allows us to build models to learn the association rules\nfrom the data. Second, we characterize drugs by profiling in chemical structure, \ndrug ATC-code annotation, and side-effect space and represent PPI similarity by a\nsymmetrical S-kernel based on protein amino acid sequence. Then the drugs and\nPPIs are correlated by Kronecker product kernel. Finally, a support vector\nmachine (SVM), is trained to predict novel associations between drugs and PPIs.\nWe validate our PrePPItar method on the well-established gold-standard dataset by\ncross-validation. We find that all chemical structure, drug ATC-code, and\nside-effect information are predictive for PPI target. Moreover, we can increase \nthe PPI target prediction coverage by integrating multiple data sources.\nFollow-up database search and pathway analysis indicate that our new predictions \nare worthy of future experimental validation.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, PrePPItar can serve as a useful tool for PPI target\ndiscovery and provides a general heterogeneous data integrative framework.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PrePPItar is available at\nhttp://doc.aporc.org/wiki/PrePPItar.\nCONTACT: ycwang@nwipb.cas.cn or ywang@amss.ac.cn\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

This situation\nrequires the development and exploitation of tailor-made, easy-to-use and\nflexible tools designed specifically for the analysis of time-series datasets.\nRESULTS: We present a novel statistical application called CLUSTERnGO, which uses\na model-based clustering algorithm that fulfils this need. This algorithm\ninvolves two components of operation. Component 1 constructs a Bayesian\nnon-parametric model (Infinite Mixture of Piecewise Linear Sequences) and\nComponent 2, which applies a novel clustering methodology (Two-Stage Clustering).\nThe software can also assign biological meaning to the identified clusters using \nan appropriate ontology. It applies multiple hypothesis testing to report the\nsignificance of these enrichments. The algorithm has a four-phase pipeline. The\napplication can be executed using either command-line tools or a user-friendly\nGraphical User Interface. The latter has been developed to address the needs of\nboth specialist and non-specialist users. We use three diverse test cases to\ndemonstrate the flexibility of the proposed strategy. In all cases, CLUSTERnGO\nnot only outperformed existing algorithms in assigning unique GO term enrichments\nto the identified clusters, but also revealed novel insights regarding the\nbiological systems examined, which were not uncovered in the original\npublications.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The C++ and QT source codes, the GUI\napplications for Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems and user manual are\nfreely available for download under the GNU GPL v3 license at\nhttp://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/content/CnG.\nCONTACT: sgo24@cam.ac.uk\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Miller School of Medicine,\nUniversity of Miami, Miami, FL 33136, USA.\n\nMOTIVATION: Aptamers are synthetic nucleic acid molecules that can bind\nbiological targets in virtue of both their sequence and three-dimensional\nstructure. Aptamers are selected using SELEX, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by \nEXponential enrichment, a technique that exploits aptamer-target binding\naffinity. The SELEX procedure, coupled with high-throughput sequencing\n(HT-SELEX), creates billions of random sequences capable of binding different\nepitopes on specific targets. Since this technique produces enormous amounts of\ndata, computational analysis represents a critical step to screen and select the \nmost biologically relevant sequences.\nRESULTS: Here, we present APTANI, a computational tool to identify\ntarget-specific aptamers from HT-SELEX data and secondary structure information. \nAPTANI builds on AptaMotif algorithm, originally implemented to analyze SELEX\ndata; extends the applicability of AptaMotif to HT-SELEX data and introduces new \nfunctionalities, as the possibility to identify binding motifs, to cluster\naptamer families or to compare output results from different HT-SELEX cycles.\nTabular and graphical representations facilitate the downstream biological\ninterpretation of results.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: APTANI is available at http://aptani.unimore.it.\nCONTACT: silvio.bicciato@unimore.it\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Here we use a comprehensive study design \nto generate Illumina RNA-seq and Affymetrix microarray data from the same liver\nsamples of rats exposed in triplicate to varying degrees of perturbation by 27\nchemicals representing multiple modes of action (MOAs). The cross-platform\nconcordance in terms of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or enriched\npathways is linearly correlated with treatment effect size (R(2)0.8).\nFurthermore, the concordance is also affected by transcript abundance and\nbiological complexity of the MOA. RNA-seq outperforms microarray (93% versus 75%)\nin DEG verification as assessed by quantitative PCR, with the gain mainly due to \nits improved accuracy for low-abundance transcripts. Nonetheless, classifiers to \npredict MOAs perform similarly when developed using data from either platform.\nTherefore, the endpoint studied and its biological complexity, transcript\nabundance and the genomic application are important factors in transcriptomic\nresearch and for clinical and regulatory decision making.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3001 \nPMCID: PMC4243706\nPMID: 25150839  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Moreover,\ncommonly used methods for normalization (cqn, EDASeq, RUV2, sva, PEER) varied in \ntheir ability to remove these systematic biases, depending on sample complexity\nand initial data quality.

However, the\nability to track the fate and function of transplanted cells with current\ntechnologies is limited. Exogenous contrast labels such as nanoparticles give a\nstrong signal in the short term but are unreliable long term. Genetically encoded\nlabels are good both short- and long-term in animals, but in the human setting\nthey raise regulatory issues related to the safety of genomic integration and\npotential immunogenicity of reporter proteins. Imaging studies in brain, heart\nand islets share a common set of challenges, including developing novel labeling \napproaches to improve detection thresholds and early delineation of toxicity and \nfunction. Key areas for future research include addressing safety concerns\nassociated with genetic labels and developing methods to follow cell survival,\ndifferentiation and integration with host tissue. Imaging may bridge the gap\nbetween cell therapies and health outcomes by elucidating mechanisms of action\nthrough longitudinal monitoring.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2993 \nPMCID: PMC4164232\nPMID: 25093889  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here, we build on recent progress with respect to nanopore\nresolution and DNA control to interpret the procession of ion current levels\nobserved during the translocation of DNA through the pore MspA. As approximately \nfour nucleotides affect the ion current of each level, we measured the ion\ncurrent corresponding to all 256 four-nucleotide combinations (quadromers). This \nquadromer map is highly predictive of ion current levels of previously unmeasured\nsequences derived from the bacteriophage phi X 174 genome. Furthermore, we show\nnanopore sequencing reads of phi X 174 up to 4,500 bases in length, which can be \nunambiguously aligned to the phi X 174 reference genome, and demonstrate\nproof-of-concept utility with respect to hybrid genome assembly and polymorphism \ndetection.

The most widely cultivated citrus, \nsweet orange, is the offspring of previously admixed individuals, but sour orange\nis an F1 hybrid of pure C. maxima and C. reticulata parents, thus implying that\nwild mandarins were part of the early breeding germplasm. A Chinese wild\n'mandarin' diverges substantially from C. reticulata, thus suggesting the\npossibility of other unrecognized wild citrus species. Understanding citrus\nphylogeny through genome analysis clarifies taxonomic relationships and\nfacilitates sequence-directed genetic improvement.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2906 \nPMCID: PMC4113729\nPMID: 24908277  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

As only definitive hematopoiesis generates HSCs, understanding how\nthis program develops is essential for being able to produce this cell population\nin vitro. Here we show that both hematopoietic programs transition through\nhemogenic endothelial intermediates and develop from KDR(+)CD34(-)CD144(-)\nprogenitors that are distinguished by CD235a expression. Generation of primitive \nprogenitors (KDR(+)CD235a(+)) depends on stage-specific activin-nodal signaling\nand inhibition of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway, whereas specification of definitive \nprogenitors (KDR(+)CD235a(-)) requires Wnt-β-catenin signaling during this same\ntime frame. Together, these findings establish simple selective differentiation\nstrategies for the generation of primitive or definitive hematopoietic\nprogenitors by Wnt-β-catenin manipulation, and in doing so provide access to\nenriched populations for future studies on hPSC-derived hematopoietic\ndevelopment.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2915 \nPMCID: PMC4152856\nPMID: 24837661  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Using\nchromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we\nmapped genome-wide binding sites of catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) in\nHEK293T cells, in combination with 12 different single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). The\nnumber of off-target sites bound by dCas9 varied from ∼10 to >1,000 depending on \nthe sgRNA. Analysis of off-target binding sites showed the importance of the\nPAM-proximal region of the sgRNA guiding sequence and that dCas9 binding sites\nare enriched in open chromatin regions. When targeted with catalytically active\nCas9, some off-target binding sites had indels above background levels in a\nregion around the ChIP-seq peak, but generally at lower rates than the on-target \nsites. Our results elucidate major determinants of Cas9 targeting, and we show\nthat ChIP-seq allows unbiased detection of Cas9 binding sites genome-wide.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2916 \nPMID: 24837660  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

To improve DNA\ncleavage specificity, we generated fusions of catalytically inactive Cas9 and\nFokI nuclease (fCas9). DNA cleavage by fCas9 requires association of two fCas9\nmonomers that simultaneously bind target sites ∼15 or 25 base pairs apart. In\nhuman cells, fCas9 modified target DNA sites with >140-fold higher specificity\nthan wild-type Cas9 and with an efficiency similar to that of paired Cas9\n'nickases', recently engineered variants that cleave only one DNA strand per\nmonomer. The specificity of fCas9 was at least fourfold higher than that of\npaired nickases at loci with highly similar off-target sites. Target sites that\nconform to the substrate requirements of fCas9 occur on average every 34 bp in\nthe human genome, suggesting the versatility of this approach for highly specific\ngenome-wide editing.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2909 \nPMCID: PMC4263420\nPMID: 24770324  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This heterogeneity arises from the multistep process of\nmammalian complex-type N-glycan synthesis. Here we report a glycoengineering\nstrategy--which we call GlycoDelete--that shortens the Golgi N-glycosylation\npathway in mammalian cells. This shortening results in the expression of proteins\nwith small, sialylated trisaccharide N-glycans and reduced complexity compared to\nnative mammalian cell glycoproteins. GlycoDelete engineering does not interfere\nwith the functioning of N-glycans in protein folding, and the physiology of cells\nmodified by GlycoDelete is similar to that of wild-type cells. A therapeutic\nhuman IgG expressed in GlycoDelete cells had properties, such as reduced initial \nclearance, that might be beneficial when the therapeutic goal is antigen\nneutralization. This strategy for reducing N-glycan heterogeneity on mammalian\nproteins could lead to more consistent performance of therapeutic proteins and\nmodulation of biopharmaceutical functions.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2885 \nPMID: 24752077  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the\nsize and diversity of the transcriptome, the wide dynamic range in gene\nexpression and inherent technical biases confound RNA-seq analysis. We have\ndeveloped a set of spike-in RNA standards, termed 'sequins' (sequencing\nspike-ins), that represent full-length spliced mRNA isoforms. Sequins have an\nentirely artificial sequence with no homology to natural reference genomes, but\nthey align to gene loci encoded on an artificial in silico chromosome. The\ncombination of multiple sequins across a range of concentrations emulates\nalternative splicing and differential gene expression, and it provides scaling\nfactors for normalization between samples. We demonstrate the use of sequins in\nRNA-seq experiments to measure sample-specific biases and determine the limits of\nreliable transcript assembly and quantification in accompanying human RNA\nsamples. In addition, we have designed a complementary set of sequins that\nrepresent fusion genes arising from rearrangements of the in silico chromosome to\naid in cancer diagnosis. RNA sequins provide a qualitative and quantitative\nreference with which to navigate the complexity of the human transcriptome.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3958 \nPMID: 27502218  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

We developed a\nnew class of FP from an allophycocyanin α-subunit (APCα). Native APC requires a\nlyase to incorporate phycocyanobilin. The evolved FP, which we named small\nultra-red FP (smURFP), covalently attaches a biliverdin (BV) chromophore without \na lyase, and has 642/670-nm excitation-emission peaks, a large extinction\ncoefficient (180,000 M(-1)cm(-1)) and quantum yield (18%), and photostability\ncomparable to that of eGFP. smURFP has significantly greater BV incorporation\nrate and protein stability than the bacteriophytochrome (BPH) FPs. Moreover, BV\nsupply is limited by membrane permeability, and smURFPs (but not BPH FPs) can\nincorporate a more membrane-permeant BV analog, making smURFP fluorescence\ncomparable to that of FPs from jellyfish or coral. A far-red and near-infrared\nfluorescent cell cycle indicator was created with smURFP and a BPH FP.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3935 \nPMCID: PMC5007177 [Available on 2017-02-01]\nPMID: 27479328  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

One technology uniquely\npositioned to provide such benefits is photoacoustic tomography (PAT), a\nsensitive modality for imaging optical absorption contrast over a range of\nspatial scales at high speed. In PAT, endogenous contrast reveals a tissue's\nanatomical, functional, metabolic, and histologic properties, and exogenous\ncontrast provides molecular and cellular specificity. The spatial scale of PAT\ncovers organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and small animals. Consequently, PAT\nis complementary to other imaging modalities in contrast mechanism, penetration, \nspatial resolution, and temporal resolution. We review the fundamentals of PAT\nand provide practical guidelines for matching PAT systems with research needs. We\nalso summarize the most promising biomedical applications of PAT, discuss related\nchallenges, and envision PAT's potential to lead to further breakthroughs.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3925 \nPMCID: PMC4980387\nPMID: 27467726  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Here, we exploit one such\nmechanism, termed -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), to engineer\nligand-responsive RNA switches that regulate protein expression. First, efficient\n-1 PRF stimulatory RNA elements were discovered by in vitro selection; then,\nligand-responsive switches were constructed by coupling -1 PRF stimulatory\nelements to RNA aptamers using rational design and directed evolution in\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that -1 PRF switches tightly control the\nrelative stoichiometry of two distinct protein outputs from a single mRNA,\nexhibiting consistent ligand response across whole populations of cells.\nFurthermore, -1 PRF switches were applied to build single-mRNA logic gates and an\napoptosis module in yeast. Together, these results showcase the potential for\nharnessing translation-reprogramming mechanisms for synthetic biology, and they\nestablish -1 PRF switches as powerful RNA tools for controlling protein synthesis\nin eukaryotes.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3807 \nPMCID: PMC4850110\nPMID: 26999002  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

However, because of the limitations of both conventional imaging\nmodalities and conventional labeling techniques, it is a challenge to localize\nmolecules in three dimensions with high precision in such samples while\nsimultaneously achieving the labeling densities required for high resolution of\ndensely crowded structures. Here we combined lattice light-sheet microscopy with \nnewly developed, freely diffusing, cell-permeable chemical probes with targeted\naffinity for DNA, intracellular membranes or the plasma membrane. We used this\ncombination to perform high-localization precision, ultrahigh-labeling density,\nmulticolor localization microscopy in samples up to 20 μm thick, including\ndividing cells and the neuromast organ of a zebrafish embryo. We also demonstrate\nsuper-resolution correlative imaging with protein-specific photoactivable\nfluorophores, providing a mutually compatible, single-platform alternative to\ncorrelative light-electron microscopy over large volumes.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3797 \nPMCID: PMC4889433\nPMID: 26950745  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Despite the significance of yeast\nlibraries and the immense variety of available tags and regulatory elements, only\na few such libraries exist, as their construction is extremely expensive and\nlaborious. To overcome these limitations, we developed a SWAp-Tag (SWAT) method\nthat enables one parental library to be modified easily and efficiently to give\nrise to an endless variety of libraries of choice. To showcase the versatility of\nthe SWAT approach, we constructed and investigated a library of ∼1,800 strains\ncarrying SWAT-GFP modules at the amino termini of endomembrane proteins and then \nused it to create two new libraries (mCherry and seamless GFP). Our work\ndemonstrates how the SWAT method allows fast and effortless creation of yeast\nlibraries, opening the door to new ways of systematically studying cell biology.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3795 \nPMCID: PMC4869835\nPMID: 26928762  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we describe the HPN-DREAM network inference challenge, which\nfocused on learning causal influences in signaling networks. We used\nphosphoprotein data from cancer cell lines as well as in silico data from a\nnonlinear dynamical model. Using the phosphoprotein data, we scored more than\n2,000 networks submitted by challenge participants. The networks spanned 32\nbiological contexts and were scored in terms of causal validity with respect to\nunseen interventional data. A number of approaches were effective, and\nincorporating known biology was generally advantageous. Additional sub-challenges\nconsidered time-course prediction and visualization. Our results suggest that\nlearning causal relationships may be feasible in complex settings such as disease\nstates. Furthermore, our scoring approach provides a practical way to empirically\nassess inferred molecular networks in a causal sense.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3773 \nPMCID: PMC4854847\nPMID: 26901648  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Recently developed DNA-targeting platforms, including zinc finger\nproteins, transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) and the clustered,\nregularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system, have\nenabled the recruitment of transcriptional modulators and epigenome-modifying\nfactors to any genomic site, leading to new insights into the function of\nepigenetic marks in gene expression. Additionally, custom transcriptional and\nepigenetic regulation is facilitating refined control over cell function and\ndecision making. The unique properties of the CRISPR-Cas9 system have created new\nopportunities for high-throughput genetic screens and multiplexing targets to\nmanipulate complex gene expression patterns. This Review summarizes recent\ntechnological developments in this area and their application to biomedical\nchallenges. We also discuss remaining limitations and necessary future directions\nfor this field.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3733 \nPMCID: PMC4922638 [Available on 2017-01-28]\nPMID: 26820547  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We describe a genetically encoded\nfluorogen-activating protein (FAP) that binds a heavy atom-substituted\nfluorogenic dye, forming an 'on-demand' activated photosensitizer that produces\nsinglet oxygen and fluorescence when activated with near-infrared light. This\ntargeted and activated photosensitizer (TAPs) approach enables protein\ninactivation, targeted cell killing and rapid targeted lineage ablation in living\nlarval and adult zebrafish. The near-infrared excitation and emission of this\nFAP-TAPs provides a new spectral range for photosensitizer proteins that could be\nuseful for imaging, manipulation and cellular ablation deep within living\norganisms.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3735 \nPMCID: PMC4916159\nPMID: 26808669  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Alternating pulsed laser excitation at three different\nwavelengths and time-resolved detection on 32 spectrally separated detection\nchannels ensures efficient excitation of fluorophores and a maximum gain of\nfluorescence information. Using spectrally resolved fluorescence lifetime imaging\nmicroscopy (sFLIM), we were able to visualize up to nine different target\nmolecules simultaneously in mouse C2C12 cells. By exploiting the sensitivity of\nfluorescence emission spectra and the lifetime of organic fluorophores on\nenvironmental factors, we carried out fluorescence imaging of three different\ntarget molecules in human U2OS cells with the same fluorophore.

Such circuits are built from quantitatively\ncharacterized genetic parts; however, this characterization is a significant\nobstacle in work with plants because of the time required for stable\ntransformation. We describe a method for rapid quantitative characterization of\ngenetic plant parts using transient expression in protoplasts and dual luciferase\noutputs.

Yet there is a lack of versatile devices that \ncan deliver spatiotemporally patterned light while performing simultaneous\nsensing to map the dynamics of perturbed neural populations at the network level.\nWe have created optoelectronic actuator and sensor microarrays that can be used\nas monolithic intracortical implants, fabricated from an optically transparent,\nelectrically highly conducting semiconductor ZnO crystal. The devices can perform\nsimultaneous light delivery and electrical readout in precise spatial registry\nacross the microprobe array. We applied the device technology in transgenic mice \nto study light-perturbed cortical microcircuit dynamics and their effects on\nbehavior. The functionality of this device can be further expanded to optical\nimaging and patterned electrical microstimulation.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3620 \nPMID: 26457862  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We describe a mass spectrometry-based standard\noperating procedure for scoring immunoprecipitation antibody quality. We\nquantified the abundance of all the proteins in immunoprecipitates of 1,124 new\nrecombinant antibodies for 152 chromatin-related human proteins by comparing\nnormalized spectral abundance factors from the target antigen with those of all\nother proteins. We validated the performance of the standard operating procedure \nin blinded studies in five independent laboratories. Antibodies for which the\ntarget antigen or a member of its known protein complex was the most abundant\nprotein were classified as 'IP gold standard'. This method generates quantitative\noutputs that can be stored and archived in public databases, and it represents a \nstep toward a platform for community benchmarking of antibody quality.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3472 \nPMID: 26121405  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In this work, we focus on the computational aspects of\nsuper-resolution microscopy and present a comprehensive evaluation of\nlocalization software packages. Our philosophy is to evaluate each package as a\nwhole, thus maintaining the integrity of the software. We prepared synthetic data\nthat represent three-dimensional structures modeled after biological components, \ntaking excitation parameters, noise sources, point-spread functions and\npixelation into account. We then asked developers to run their software on our\ndata; most responded favorably, allowing us to present a broad picture of the\nmethods available. We evaluated their results using quantitative and\nuser-interpretable criteria: detection rate, accuracy, quality of image\nreconstruction, resolution, software usability and computational resources.

We used engineered CRISPR (clustered\nregularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) to efficiently mutate specific\nloci in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and screen for genes involved in vertebrate\nbiological processes. We found that increasing CRISPR efficiency by injecting\noptimized amounts of Cas9-encoding mRNA and multiplexing single guide RNAs\n(sgRNAs) allowed for phenocopy of known mutants across many phenotypes in\nembryos. We performed a proof-of-concept screen in which we used intersecting,\nmultiplexed pool injections to examine 48 loci and identified two new genes\ninvolved in electrical-synapse formation. By deep sequencing target loci, we\nfound that 90% of the genes were effectively screened. We conclude that CRISPR\ncan be used as a powerful reverse genetic screening strategy in vivo in a\nvertebrate system.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3360 \nPMCID: PMC4667794\nPMID: 25867848  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

These rules relate the base specified by a single TALE repeat to the\nidentity of two key residues (the repeat variable diresidue, or RVD) and enable\ndesign for new sequence targets via modular shuffling of these units. A key\nlimitation of these rules is that their simplicity precludes options for\nimproving designs that are insufficiently active or specific. Here we address\nthis limitation by developing an expanded set of RVDs and applying them to\nimprove the performance of previously described TALEs. As an extreme example,\ntotal conversion of a TALE nuclease to new RVDs substantially reduced off-target \ncleavage in cellular studies. By providing new RVDs and design strategies, these \nstudies establish options for developing improved TALEs for broader application\nacross medicine and biotechnology.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3330 \nPMID: 25799440  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The method\nintegrates Monte Carlo sampling with local density-guided optimization, Rosetta\nall-atom refinement and real-space B-factor fitting. In tests on experimental\nmaps of three different systems with 4.5-Å resolution or better, the method\nconsistently produced models with atomic-level accuracy largely independently of \nstarting-model quality, and it outperformed the molecular dynamics-based MDFF\nmethod. Cross-validated model quality statistics correlated with model accuracy\nover the three test systems.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3286 \nPMCID: PMC4382417\nPMID: 25707030  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we\ndescribe a method called DNase Hi-C for comprehensively mapping global chromatin \ncontacts. DNase Hi-C uses DNase I for chromatin fragmentation, leading to greatly\nimproved efficiency and resolution over that of Hi-C. Coupling this method with\nDNA-capture technology provides a high-throughput approach for targeted mapping\nof fine-scale chromatin architecture. We applied targeted DNase Hi-C to\ncharacterize the 3D organization of 998 large intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) \npromoters in two human cell lines. Our results revealed that expression of\nlincRNAs is tightly controlled by complex mechanisms involving both\nsuper-enhancers and the Polycomb repressive complex. Our results provide the\nfirst glimpse of the cell type-specific 3D organization of lincRNA genes.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3205 \nPMCID: PMC4281301\nPMID: 25437436  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

When approached by a remote-operated vehicle \n(rover) which can be equipped to make radio-frequency identifications, wild\npenguins had significantly lower and shorter stress responses (determined by\nheart rate and behavior) than when approached by humans. Upon immobilization, the\nrover-unlike humans-did not disorganize colony structure, and stress rapidly\nceased. Thus, rovers can reduce human disturbance of wild animals and the\nresulting scientific bias.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3173 \nPMID: 25362361  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We have assembled an expression platform with an\nembedded modular ribozyme scaffold that correlates self-cleavage activity of\ndesigner ribozymes with transgene translation in bacteria and mammalian cells. A \ndesign approach devised to screen ribozyme libraries in bacteria and validate\nvariants with functional tertiary stem-loop structures in mammalian cells\nresulted in a designer ribozyme with a protein-binding nutR-boxB stem II and a\nselected matching stem I. In a mammalian expression context, this designer\nribozyme exhibited dose-dependent translation control by the N-peptide, had rapid\ninduction kinetics and could be combined with classic small molecule-responsive\ntranscription control modalities to construct complex, programmable genetic\ncircuits.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3136 \nPMID: 25282610  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Success of structure based drug\ndiscovery severely hinges on the availability of structures. Despite significant \nprogresses in the area of experimental protein structure determination, the\nsequence-structure gap is continually widening. Data driven homology based\ncomputational methods have proved successful in predicting tertiary structures\nfor sequences sharing medium to high sequence similarities. With dwindling\nsimilarities of query sequences, advanced homology/ ab initio hybrid approaches\nare being explored to solve structure prediction problem. Here we describe\nBhageerath-H, a homology/ ab initio hybrid software/server for predicting protein\ntertiary structures with advancing drug design attempts as one of the goals.\nRESULTS: Bhageerath-H web-server was validated on 75 CASP10 targets which showed \nTM-scores ≥ 0.5 in 91% of the cases and Cα RMSDs ≤ 5 Å from the native in 58% of \nthe targets, which is well above the CASP10 water mark. Comparison with some\nleading servers demonstrated the uniqueness of the hybrid methodology in\neffectively sampling conformational space, scoring best decoys and refining low\nresolution models to high and medium resolution.\nCONCLUSION: Bhageerath-H methodology is web enabled for the scientific community \nas a freely accessible web server. The methodology is fielded in the on-going\nCASP11 experiment.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S7 \nPMCID: PMC4290660\nPMID: 25521245  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Given a peptide sequence (or elemental formula) and charge state, the \nmass-to-charge ratios of deuterium-associated peaks of the specified ion is\ndetermined. Intensities of peaks in an experimental mass spectrum within bins\ncorresponding to these values are used to determine the distribution of deuterium\nincorporated. A theoretical spectrum can then be calculated based on the\nestimated distribution of deuterium exchange to confirm interpretation of the\nspectrum. Deuterium incorporation can also be detected for ion signals without a \npriori specification of an elemental formula, permitting detection of exchange in\ncomplex samples of unidentified material such as natural organic matter. A tool\nis also incorporated into QUDeX-MS to help in assigning ion signals from peptides\narising from enzymatic digestion of proteins. MATLAB-deployable and standalone\nversions are available for academic use at qudex-ms.sourceforge.net and\nagarlabs.com .\nCONCLUSION: Isotopic fine structure HDX-MS offers the potential to increase\nsequence coverage of proteins being analyzed through mass accuracy and\ndeconvolution of overlapping ion signals. As previously demonstrated, however,\nthe data analysis workflow for HDX-MS data with resolved isotopic fine structure \nis distinct. QUDeX-MS we hope will aid in the adoption of isotopic fine structure\nHDX-MS by providing an intuitive workflow and interface for data analysis.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0403-1 \nPMCID: PMC4274694\nPMID: 25495703  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

It\nis initiated via programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and involves a\nspecific axial chromosomal structure. So far, recombination regions have been\nmainly determined by experiments, both expensive and time-consuming.\nRESULTS: SPoRE is a mathematical model that describes the non-uniform\nlocalisation of DSB and axis proteins sites, and distinguishes high versus low\nprotein density. It is based on a combination of genomic signals, based on what\nis known from wet-lab experiments, whose contribution is precisely quantified. It\nmodels axis proteins accumulation at gene 5'-ends with a discrete approximation\nof their diffusion and convection along genes. It models DSB accumulation at\napproximated gene promoter positions with intergenic region length and\nGC-content. SPoRE can be used for prediction and it is parameterised in an\nobvious way that makes it easy to understand from a biological viewpoint.\nCONCLUSIONS: When compared to Saccharomyces cerevisiae experimental data, SPoRE\npredicts axis protein and DSB positions with high sensitivity and precision, axis\nprotein density with an average local correlation r = 0.63 and DSB density with\nan average local correlation r = 0.62. SPoRE outbreaks previous DSB predictors,\nwhich are based on nucleotide patterning, and it reaches 85% of success rate in\nDSB prediction compared to 54% obtained by available tools on a benchmarked\ndataset.SPoRE is available at the address http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/SPoRE/.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0391-1 \nPMCID: PMC4268827\nPMID: 25495332  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Most effort in modeling these datasets\nfocuses on the detection of univariate differentially expressed genes. However,\nfor classification, we must consider multiple genes and their interactions.\nRESULTS: Thus, we introduce a hierarchical multivariate Poisson model (MP) and\nthe associated optimal Bayesian classifier (OBC) for classifying samples using\nsequencing data. Lacking closed-form solutions, we employ a Monte Carlo Markov\nChain (MCMC) approach to perform classification. We demonstrate superior or\nequivalent classification performance compared to typical classifiers for two\nsynthetic datasets and over a range of classification problem difficulties. We\nalso introduce the Bayesian minimum mean squared error (MMSE) conditional error\nestimator and demonstrate its computation over the feature space. In addition, we\ndemonstrate superior or leading class performance over an RNA-Seq dataset\ncontaining two lung cancer tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\nCONCLUSIONS: Through model-based, optimal Bayesian classification, we demonstrate\nsuperior classification performance for both synthetic and real RNA-Seq datasets.\nA tutorial video and Python source code is available under an open source license\nat http://bit.ly/1gimnss .\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0401-3 \nPMCID: PMC4265360\nPMID: 25491122  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Despite the importance\nof Gene Set Analysis (GSA) in the interpretation of the results from RNA-Seq\nexperiments, the limitations of GSA methods developed for microarrays in the\ncontext of RNA-Seq data are not well understood.\nRESULTS: We provide a thorough evaluation of popular multivariate and gene-level \nself-contained GSA approaches on simulated and real RNA-Seq data. The\nmultivariate approach employs multivariate non-parametric tests combined with\npopular normalizations for RNA-Seq data. The gene-level approach utilizes\nunivariate tests designed for the analysis of RNA-Seq data to find gene-specific \nP-values and combines them into a pathway P-value using classical statistical\ntechniques. Our results demonstrate that the Type I error rate and the power of\nmultivariate tests depend only on the test statistics and are insensitive to the \ndifferent normalizations. In general standard multivariate GSA tests detect\npathways that do not have any bias in terms of pathways size, percentage of\ndifferentially expressed genes, or average gene length in a pathway. In contrast \nthe Type I error rate and the power of gene-level GSA tests are heavily affected \nby the methods for combining P-values, and all aforementioned biases are present \nin detected pathways.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our result emphasizes the importance of using self-contained\nnon-parametric multivariate tests for detecting differentially expressed pathways\nfor RNA-Seq data and warns against applying gene-level GSA tests, especially\nbecause of their high level of Type I error rates for both, simulated and real\ndata.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0397-8 \nPMCID: PMC4265362\nPMID: 25475910  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we present Wishbone, an algorithm for\npositioning single cells along bifurcating developmental trajectories with high\nresolution. Wishbone uses multi-dimensional single-cell data, such as mass\ncytometry or RNA-Seq data, as input and orders cells according to their\ndevelopmental progression, and it pinpoints bifurcation points by labeling each\ncell as pre-bifurcation or as one of two post-bifurcation cell fates. Using\n30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone accurately recovers the\nknown stages of T-cell development in the mouse thymus, including the bifurcation\npoint. We also apply the algorithm to mouse myeloid differentiation and\ndemonstrate its generalization to additional lineages.

Current technologies allow whole-transcriptome\nsequencing of spatially identified cells but lack the throughput needed to\ncharacterize complex tissues. Here we present a high-throughput method to\nidentify the spatial origin of cells assayed by single-cell RNA-sequencing within\na tissue of interest. Our approach is based on comparing complete,\nspecificity-weighted mRNA profiles of a cell with positional gene expression\nprofiles derived from a gene expression atlas. We show that this method allocates\ncells to precise locations in the brain of the marine annelid Platynereis\ndumerilii with a success rate of 81%. Our method is applicable to any system that\nhas a reference gene expression database of sufficiently high resolution.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3209 \nPMID: 25867922  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

To better map\ntranscription factor binding genome-wide at nucleotide resolution in vivo, we\nhave developed a robust ChIP-exo protocol called ChIP-nexus (chromatin\nimmunoprecipitation experiments with nucleotide resolution through exonuclease,\nunique barcode and single ligation), which utilizes an efficient DNA\nself-circularization step during library preparation. Application of ChIP-nexus\nto four proteins--human TBP and Drosophila NFkB, Twist and Max--shows that it\noutperforms existing ChIP protocols in resolution and specificity, pinpoints\nrelevant binding sites within enhancers containing multiple binding motifs, and\nallows for the analysis of in vivo binding specificities. Notably, we show that\nMax frequently interacts with DNA sequences next to its motif, and that this\nbinding pattern correlates with local DNA-sequence features such as DNA shape.\nChIP-nexus will be broadly applicable to the study of in vivo transcription\nfactor binding specificity and its relationship to cis-regulatory changes in\nhumans and model organisms.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3121 \nPMCID: PMC4390430\nPMID: 25751057  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, characterizing somatic structural variants in\ntumor genomes is still challenging because current strategies depend on the\ninitial alignment of reads to a reference genome. Here, we describe SMUFIN\n(somatic mutation finder), a single program that directly compares sequence reads\nfrom normal and tumor genomes to accurately identify and characterize a range of \nsomatic sequence variation, from single-nucleotide variants (SNV) to large\nstructural variants at base pair resolution. Performance tests on modeled tumor\ngenomes showed average sensitivity of 92% and 74% for SNVs and structural\nvariants, with specificities of 95% and 91%, respectively. Analyses of aggressive\nforms of solid and hematological tumors revealed that SMUFIN identifies\nbreakpoints associated with chromothripsis and chromoplexy with high specificity.\nSMUFIN provides an integrated solution for the accurate, fast and comprehensive\ncharacterization of somatic sequence variation in cancer.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3027 \nPMID: 25344728  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Central to Perseus is a\nuser-friendly, interactive workflow environment that provides complete\ndocumentation of computational methods used in a publication. All activities in\nPerseus are realized as plugins, and users can extend the software by programming\ntheir own, which can be shared through a plugin store. We anticipate that\nPerseus's arsenal of algorithms and its intuitive usability will empower\ninterdisciplinary analysis of complex large data sets.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3901 \nPMID: 27348712  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

There are several approaches available\nfor analyzing somatic point mutations and small insertions or deletions, but an\naccurate genome-wide assessment of somatic structural variants (somSVs) in bulk\nDNA is still not possible.

As a \nresult, it is difficult to assess the performance of orthology inference methods.\nHere, we present a community effort to establish standards and an automated\nweb-based service to facilitate orthology benchmarking. Using this service, we\ncharacterize 15 well-established inference methods and resources on a battery of \n20 different benchmarks. Standardized benchmarking provides a way for users to\nidentify the most effective methods for the problem at hand, sets a minimum\nrequirement for new tools and resources, and guides the development of more\naccurate orthology inference methods.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3830 \nPMCID: PMC4827703\nPMID: 27043882  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Using\nbrain registration across hundreds of larval zebrafish, we have built an\nexpandable open-source atlas containing molecular labels and definitions of\nanatomical regions, the Z-Brain. Using this platform and immunohistochemical\ndetection of phosphorylated extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) as a\nreadout of neural activity, we have developed a system to create and\ncontextualize whole-brain maps of stimulus- and behavior-dependent neural\nactivity. This mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP)-mapping assay is\ntechnically simple, and data analysis is completely automated. Because\nMAP-mapping is performed on freely swimming fish, it is applicable to studies of \nnearly any stimulus or behavior. Here we demonstrate our high-throughput approach\nusing pharmacological, visual and noxious stimuli, as well as hunting and\nfeeding.

Analysis of 3D in vivo images, however, is very\nchallenging. Today's best practice, manual annotation of select image events,\ngenerates arbitrarily sampled data distributions, which are unsuitable for\nreliable mechanistic inferences. Here, we present an integrated workflow for\nquantitative in vivo cell-cycle profiling. It combines image analysis and machine\nlearning methods for automated 3D segmentation and cell-cycle state\nidentification of individual cell-nuclei with widely varying morphologies\nembedded in complex tumor environments. We applied our workflow to quantify\ncell-cycle effects of three antimitotic cancer drugs over 8 d in HT-1080\nfibrosarcoma xenografts in living mice using a data set of 38,000 cells and\ncompared the induced phenotypes. In contrast to results with 2D culture, observed\nmitotic arrest was relatively low, suggesting involvement of additional\nmechanisms in their antitumor effect in vivo.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3363 \nPMCID: PMC4579269\nPMID: 25867850  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Predicted TREs are more\nenriched for several marks of transcriptional activation—including expression\nquantitative trait loci, disease-associated polymorphisms, acetylated histone 3\nlysine 27 (H3K27ac) and transcription factor binding—than those identified by\nalternative functional assays.

We developed ribose-seq, a method for\ncapturing unique products generated by alkaline cleavage of DNA at embedded\nribonucleotides. High-throughput sequencing of these fragments in DNA from the\nyeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed widespread ribonucleotide distribution,\nwith a strong preference for cytidine and guanosine, and identified hotspots of\nribonucleotide incorporation in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Ribonucleotides\nwere primarily incorporated on the newly synthesized leading strand of nuclear\nDNA and were present upstream of (G+C)-rich tracts in the mitochondrial genome.\nRibose-seq is a powerful tool for the systematic profiling of ribonucleotide\nincorporation in genomic DNA.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3259 \nPMCID: PMC4686381\nPMID: 25622106  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

They show promise as high-affinity reagents\nfor research, diagnostics and therapeutics owing to their high specificity, small\nsize (∼15 kDa) and straightforward bacterial expression. However, identification \nof repertoires with sufficiently high affinity has proven time consuming and\ndifficult, hampering nanobody implementation. Our approach generates large\nrepertoires of readily expressible recombinant nanobodies with high affinities\nand specificities against a given antigen. We demonstrate the efficacy of this\napproach through the production of large repertoires of nanobodies against two\nantigens, GFP and mCherry, with Kd values into the subnanomolar range. After\nmapping diverse epitopes on GFP, we were also able to design ultrahigh-affinity\ndimeric nanobodies with Kd values as low as ∼30 pM. The approach presented here\nis well suited for the routine production of high-affinity capture reagents for\nvarious biomedical applications.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3170 \nPMCID: PMC4272012\nPMID: 25362362  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We\nhave developed an experimental and computational workflow combining photo-induced\ncross-linking, high-resolution mass spectrometry and automated analysis of the\nresulting mass spectra for the identification of cross-linked peptides,\ncross-linking sites and the cross-linked RNA oligonucleotide moieties of such\nRNA-binding proteins. The workflow can be applied to any RNA-protein complex of\ninterest or to whole proteomes. We applied the approach to human and yeast\nmRNA-protein complexes in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating its powerful utility\nby identifying 257 cross-linking sites on 124 distinct RNA-binding proteins.

Yet, differential flux profiling on a\ngenome-scale level remains one of the biggest challenges in systems biology. This\nis particularly relevant in plants, for which fluxes in autotrophic growth\nnecessitate time-consuming instationary labeling experiments and costly\ncomputations, feasible for small-scale networks.\nRESULTS: Here we present a computationally and experimentally facile approach,\ntermed iReMet-Flux, which integrates relative metabolomics data in a metabolic\nmodel to predict differential fluxes at a genome-scale level. Our approach and\nits variants complement the flux estimation methods based on radioactive tracer\nlabeling. We employ iReMet-Flux with publically available metabolic profiles to\npredict reactions and pathways with altered fluxes in photo-autotrophically grown\nArabidopsis and four photorespiratory mutants undergoing high-to-low CO2\nacclimation. We also provide predictions about reactions and pathways which are\nmost strongly regulated in the investigated experiments. The robustness and\nvariability analyses, tailored to the formulation of iReMet-Flux, demonstrate\nthat the findings provide biologically relevant information that is validated\nwith external measurements of net CO2 exchange and biomass production. Therefore,\niReMet-Flux paves the wave for mechanistic dissection of the interplay between\npathways of primary and secondary metabolisms at a genome-scale.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available from the authors\nupon request.\nCONTACT: nikoloski@mpimp-golm.mpg.de\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

(2)Department of \nStatistics, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA. (3)Department of Chemistry,\nUniversity of the Pacific, Stockton, CA, USA.\n\nMOTIVATION: By simplifying the many-bodied complexity of residue packing into\npatterns of simple pairwise secondary structure interactions between a single\nknob residue with a three-residue socket, the knob-socket construct allows a more\ndirect incorporation of structural information into the prediction of residue\ncontacts. By modeling the preferences between the amino acid composition of a\nsocket and knob, we undertake an investigation of the knob-socket construct's\nability to improve the prediction of residue contacts. The statistical model\nconsiders three priors and two posterior estimations to better understand how the\ninput data affects predictions. This produces six implementations of KScons that \nare tested on three sets: PSICOV, CASP10 and CASP11. We compare against the\ncurrent leading contact prediction methods.\nRESULTS: The results demonstrate the usefulness as well as the limits of\nknob-socket based structural modeling of protein contacts. The construct is able \nto extract good predictions from known structural homologs, while its performance\ndegrades when no homologs exist. Among our six implementations, KScons MST-MP\n(which uses the multiple structure alignment prior and marginal posterior\nincorporating structural homolog information) performs the best in all three\nprediction sets. An analysis of recall and precision finds that KScons MST-MP\nimproves accuracy not only by improving identification of true positives, but\nalso by decreasing the number of false positives. Over the CASP10 and CASP11\nsets, KScons MST-MP performs better than the leading methods using only\nevolutionary coupling data, but not quite as well as the supervised learning\nmethods of MetaPSICOV and CoinDCA-NN that incorporate a large set of structural\nfeatures.\nCONTACT: qiwei.li@rice.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

These methods should have high predictive\naccuracy and be easily interpretable by ageing experts. To enable this, one needs\ninterpretable classification models (supervised machine learning) and features\nwith rich biological meaning. In this paper we propose two interpretable feature \ntypes based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and\ncompare them with traditional feature types in hierarchical classification (a\nmore challenging classification task regarding predictive performance) and binary\nclassification (a classification task producing easier to interpret\nclassification models). As far as we know, this work is the first to: (i) explore\nthe potential of the KEGG pathway data in the hierarchical classification\nsetting, (i) use the graph structure of KEGG pathways to create a feature type\nthat quantifies the influence of a current protein on another specific protein\nwithin a KEGG pathway graph and (iii) propose a method for interpreting the\nclassification models induced using KEGG features.\nRESULTS: We performed tests measuring predictive accuracy considering\nhierarchical and binary class labels extracted from the Mouse Phenotype Ontology.\nOne of the KEGG feature types leads to the highest predictive accuracy among five\nindividual feature types across three hierarchical classification algorithms.\nAdditionally, the combination of the two KEGG feature types proposed in this work\nresults in one of the best predictive accuracies when using the binary class\nversion of our datasets, at the same time enabling the extraction of knowledge\nfrom ageing-related data using quantitative influence information.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The datasets created in this paper will be\nfreely available after publication.\nCONTACT: ff79@kent.ac.uk\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

The understanding of\nglobal metabolic pathways is extremely important for various applications in\necology and pharmacology. However, large parts of metabolic pathways remain\nunknown, and most organism-specific pathways contain many missing enzymes.\nRESULTS: In this study we propose a novel method to predict the enzyme orthologs \nthat catalyze the putative reactions to facilitate the de novo reconstruction of \nmetabolic pathways from metabolome-scale compound sets. The algorithm detects the\nchemical transformation patterns of substrate-product pairs using chemical graph \nalignments, and constructs a set of enzyme-specific classifiers to simultaneously\npredict all the enzyme orthologs that could catalyze the putative reactions of\nthe substrate-product pairs in the joint learning framework. The originality of\nthe method lies in its ability to make predictions for thousands of enzyme\northologs simultaneously, as well as its extraction of enzyme-specific chemical\ntransformation patterns of substrate-product pairs.

Recently, a computational method \nwas able to reverse-engineer the first mechanistic model of planarian\nregeneration that can recapitulate the main anterior-posterior patterning\nexperiments published in the literature. Validating this comprehensive regulatory\nmodel via novel experiments that had not yet been performed would add in our\nunderstanding of the remarkable regeneration capacity of planarian worms and\ndemonstrate the power of this automated methodology.\nRESULTS: Using the Michigan Molecular Interactions and STRING databases and the\nMoCha software tool, we characterized as hnf4 an unknown regulatory gene\npredicted to exist by the reverse-engineered dynamic model of planarian\nregeneration. Then, we used the dynamic model to predict the morphological\noutcomes under different single and multiple knock-downs (RNA interference) of\nhnf4 and its predicted gene pathway interactors β-catenin and hh Interestingly,\nthe model predicted that RNAi of hnf4 would rescue the abnormal regenerated\nphenotype (tailless) of RNAi of hh in amputated trunk fragments. Finally, we\nvalidated these predictions in vivo by performing the same surgical and genetic\nexperiments with planarian worms, obtaining the same phenotypic outcomes\npredicted by the reverse-engineered model.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that hnf4 is a regulatory gene in planarian\nregeneration, validate the computational predictions of the reverse-engineered\ndynamic model, and demonstrate the automated methodology for the discovery of\nnovel genes, pathways and experimental phenotypes.\nCONTACT: michael.levin@tufts.edu.\n\n© The Author 2016.

(2)European Molecular Biology\nLaboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, EMBL-EBI, Wellcome Trust Genome\nCampus, Hinxton, UK.\n\nMOTIVATION: Public and private repositories of experimental data are growing to\nsizes that require dedicated methods for finding relevant data. To improve on the\nstate of the art of keyword searches from annotations, methods for content-based \nretrieval have been proposed. In the context of gene expression experiments, most\nmethods retrieve gene expression profiles, requiring each experiment to be\nexpressed as a single profile, typically of case versus control. A more general, \nrecently suggested alternative is to retrieve experiments whose models are good\nfor modelling the query dataset. However, for very noisy and high-dimensional\nquery data, this retrieval criterion turns out to be very noisy as well.\nRESULTS: We propose doing retrieval using a denoised model of the query dataset, \ninstead of the original noisy dataset itself. To this end, we introduce a general\nprobabilistic framework, where each experiment is modelled separately and the\nretrieval is done by finding related models. For retrieval of gene expression\nexperiments, we use a probabilistic model called product partition model, which\ninduces a clustering of genes that show similar expression patterns across a\nnumber of samples. The suggested metric for retrieval using clusterings is the\nnormalized information distance. Empirical results finally suggest that inference\nfor the full probabilistic model can be approximated with good performance using \ncomputationally faster heuristic clustering approaches (e.g. k-means). The method\nis highly scalable and straightforward to apply to construct a general-purpose\ngene expression experiment retrieval method.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method can be implemented using standard\nclustering algorithms and normalized information distance, available in many\nstatistical software packages.\nCONTACT: paul.blomstedt@aalto.fi or samuel.kaski@aalto.fi\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

ERGC wins only when one of the genomes (referential or\ntarget) contains mixed-cased letters (which is the case for only the two Korean\ngenomes). In all other cases ERGC is on average an order of magnitude worse than \nGDC and iDoComp.\nCONTACT: sebastian.deorowicz@polsl.pl, iochoa@stanford.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Reference points are\noften chosen for practical reasons. For example, we might want to assess the\nmetabolome of a diseased organ but can only measure metabolites in blood or\nurine. In this case the observable data only indirectly reflects the disease\nstate. The statistical implications of these discrepancies in reference points\nhave not yet been discussed.\nRESULTS: Here we show that reference point discrepancies compromise the\nperformance of regression models like the LASSO. As an alternative, we suggest\nzero-sum regression for a reference point insensitive analysis. We show that\nzero-sum regression is superior to the LASSO in case of a poor choice of\nreference point both in simulations and in an application that integrates\nintestinal microbiome analysis with metabolomics. Moreover, we describe a novel\ncoordinate descent based algorithm to fit zero-sum elastic nets.\nAVAILABILITY: The R-package \"zeroSum\" can be downloaded at\nhttps://github.com/rehbergT/zeroSum Moreover, we provide all R-scripts and data\nused to produce the results of this manuscript as supplementary material.\nCONTACT: Michael.Altenbuchinger@ukr.de, Thorsten.Rehberg@ukr.de, and\nRainer.Spang@ukr.de SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary material is\navailable at Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author (2016).

While much work has focused on trying to\nexperimentally and computationally determine the set of transcription-factors\n(TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate genes in these networks, relatively\nlittle work has focused on inferring the regulation of miRNAs by TFs. Such\nregulation can play an important role in several biological processes including\ndevelopment and disease. The main challenge for predicting such interactions is\nthe very small positive training set currently available. Another challenge is\nthe fact that a large fraction of miRNAs are encoded within genes making it hard \nto determine the specific way in which they are regulated.\nRESULTS: To enable genome wide predictions of TF-miRNA interactions, we extended \nsemi-supervised machine-learning approaches to integrate a large set of different\ntypes of data including sequence, expression, ChIP-seq and epigenetic data. As we\nshow, the methods we develop achieve good performance on both a labeled test set,\nand when analyzing general co-expression networks. We next analyze mRNA and miRNA\ncancer expression data, demonstrating the advantage of using the predicted set of\ninteractions for identifying more coherent and relevant modules, genes, and\nmiRNAs. The complete set of predictions is available on the supporting website\nand can be used by any method that combines miRNAs, genes, and TFs.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Code and full set of predictions are available\nfrom the supporting website: http://cs.cmu.edu/~mruffalo/tf-mirna/\nCONTACT: zivbj@cs.cmu.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

These structural transitions can often be\nrationalized in terms of relative movements of rigid domains. There is a need for\nobjective and automated methods that identify rigid domains in sets of protein\nstructures showing alternative conformational states.\nRESULTS: We present a probabilistic model for detecting rigid-body movements in\nprotein structures. Our model aims to approximate alternative conformational\nstates by a few structural parts that are rigidly transformed under the action of\na rotation and a translation. By using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte \nCarlo sampling, we estimate all parameters of the model, including a segmentation\nof the protein into rigid domains, the structures of the domains themselves, and \nthe rigid transformations that generate the observed structures. We find that our\nGibbs sampling algorithm can also estimate the optimal number of rigid domains\nwith high efficiency and accuracy. We assess the power of our method on several\nthousand entries of the DynDom database and discuss applications to various\ncomplex biomolecular systems.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Python source code for protein ensemble\nanalysis is available at: https://github.com/thachnguyen/motion_detection\nCONTACT: : mhabeck@gwdg.de.\n\n© The Author 2016.

(2)Toyota Technological \nInstitute at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.\n\nMOTIVATION: Protein intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play an important\nrole in many biological processes. Two key properties of IDRs are (i) the\noccurrence is proteome-wide and (ii) the ratio of disordered residues is about\n6%, which makes it challenging to accurately predict IDRs. Most IDR prediction\nmethods use sequence profile to improve accuracy, which prevents its application \nto proteome-wide prediction since it is time-consuming to generate sequence\nprofiles. On the other hand, the methods without using sequence profile fare much\nworse than using sequence profile.\nMETHOD: This article formulates IDR prediction as a sequence labeling problem and\nemploys a new machine learning method called Deep Convolutional Neural Fields\n(DeepCNF) to solve it. DeepCNF is an integration of deep convolutional neural\nnetworks (DCNN) and conditional random fields (CRF); it can model not only\ncomplex sequence-structure relationship in a hierarchical manner, but also\ncorrelation among adjacent residues. To deal with highly imbalanced\norder/disorder ratio, instead of training DeepCNF by widely used\nmaximum-likelihood, we develop a novel approach to train it by maximizing area\nunder the ROC curve (AUC), which is an unbiased measure for class-imbalanced\ndata.\nRESULTS: Our experimental results show that our IDR prediction method AUCpreD\noutperforms existing popular disorder predictors. More importantly, AUCpreD works\nvery well even without sequence profile, comparing favorably to or even\noutperforming many methods using sequence profile.

A minimal requirement for thermodynamic feasibility of \nthe flux solution is the absence of internal loops, which are enforced using\n'loopless constraints'. The resulting loopless flux problem is a substantially\nharder MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem, which is computationally \nexpensive for large metabolic models.\nRESULTS: We developed a pre-processing algorithm that significantly reduces the\nsize of the original loopless problem into an easier and equivalent MILP problem.\nThe pre-processing step employs a fast matrix sparsification algorithm-Fast-\nsparse null-space pursuit (SNP)-inspired by recent results on SNP. By finding a\nreduced feasible 'loop-law' matrix subject to known directionalities, Fast-SNP\nconsiderably improves the computational efficiency in several metabolic models\nrunning different loopless optimization problems. Furthermore, analysis of the\ntopology encoded in the reduced loop matrix enabled identification of key\ndirectional constraints for the potential permanent elimination of infeasible\nloops in the underlying model. Overall, Fast-SNP is an effective and simple\nalgorithm for efficient formulation of loop-law constraints, making loopless flux\noptimization feasible and numerically tractable at large scale.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code for MATLAB including examples is\nfreely available for download at http://www.aibn.uq.edu.au/cssb-resources under\nSoftware.

Thanks to recent\nadvances in sequencing technologies, \"liquid biopsy\", the sampling of patient's\nbodily fluids such as blood and urine, is considered as one of the most promising\napproaches to achieve this goal. In many cancer patients, and especially those\nwith advanced metastatic disease, deep sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA\n(cfDNA) obtained from patient's blood yields a mixture of reads originating from \nthe normal DNA and from multiple tumour subclones - called circulating tumour DNA\nor ctDNA. The ctDNA/cfDNA ratio as well as the proportion of ctDNA originating\nfrom specific tumour subclones depend on multiple factors, making comprehensive\ndetection of mutations difficult, especially at early stages of cancer.\nFurthermore, sensitive and accurate detection of SNVs and indels from cfDNA is\nconstrained by several factors such as the sequencing errors and PCR artifacts,\nand mapping errors related to repeat regions within the genome. In this paper, we\nintroduce SiNVICT, a computational method that increases the sensitivity and\nspecificity of SNV and indel detection at very low variant allele frequencies.\nSiNVICT has the capability to handle multiple sequencing platforms with different\nerror properties; it minimises false positives resulting from mapping errors and \nother technology specific artifacts including strand bias and low base quality at\nread ends. SiNVICT also has the capability to perform time-series analysis, where\nsamples from a patient sequenced at multiple time points are jointly examined to \nreport locations of interest where there is a possibility that certain clones\nwere wiped out by some treatment while some subclones gained selective advantage.\nRESULTS: We tested SiNVICT on simulated data as well as prostate cancer cell\nlines and cfDNA obtained from castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. On\nboth simulated and biological data, SiNVICT was able to detect SNVs and indels\nwith variant allele percentages as low as 0.5%. The lowest amounts of total DNA\nused for the biological data where SNVs and indels could be detected with very\nhigh sensitivity were 2.5ng on the Ion Torrent platform and 10ng on Illumina.\nWith increased sequencing and mapping accuracy, SiNVICT might be utilised in\nclinical settings, making it possible to track the progress of point mutations\nand indels that are associated with resistance to cancer therapies and provide\npatients personalised treatment. We also compared SiNVICT with other popular SNV \ncallers such as MuTect, VarScan2, and Freebayes. Our results show that SiNVICT\nperforms better than these tools in most cases and allows further data\nexploration such as time-series analysis on cfDNA sequencing data.\nAVAILABILITY: SiNVICT is available at: https://sfu-compbio.github.io/sinvict\nCONTACT: cenk@sfu.ca.\n\n© The Author (2016).

Several methods have been proposed to predict the effect \nof mutations on protein stability; but most require features from experimental\nstructure. Given the fast progress in protein structure prediction, this work\nexplores the possibility to improve the mutation-induced stability change\nprediction using low-resolution structure modeling.\nRESULTS: We developed a new method (STRUM) for predicting stability change caused\nby single-point mutations. Starting from wild-type sequences, 3D models are\nconstructed by the iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER)\nsimulations, where physics- and knowledge-based energy functions are derived on\nthe I-TASSER models and used to train STRUM models through gradient boosting\nregression. STRUM was assessed by 5-fold cross validation on 3421 experimentally \ndetermined mutations from 150 proteins. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)\nbetween predicted and measured changes of Gibbs free-energy gap, ΔΔG, upon\nmutation reaches 0.79 with a root-mean-square error 1.2 kcal/mol in the\nmutation-based cross-validations. The PCC reduces if separating training and test\nmutations from non-homologous proteins, which reflects inherent correlations in\nthe current mutation sample. Nevertheless, the results significantly outperform\nother state-of-the-art methods, including those built on experimental protein\nstructures. Detailed analyses show that the most sensitive features in STRUM are \nthe physics-based energy terms on I-TASSER models and the conservation scores\nfrom multiple-threading template alignments. However, the ΔΔG prediction accuracy\nhas only a marginal dependence on the accuracy of protein structure models as\nlong as the global fold is correct. These data demonstrate the feasibility to use\nlow-resolution structure modeling for high-accuracy stability change prediction\nupon point mutations.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/STRUM/\nCONTACT: qiang@suda.edu.cn and zhng@umich.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

For a detailed understanding of the biological processes, the\nstructure of the protein complex is essential. Given the current experimental\ntechniques for structure determination, the vast majority of all protein\ncomplexes will never be solved by experimental techniques. In lack of\nexperimental data, computational docking methods can be used to predict the\nstructure of the protein complex. A common strategy is to generate many\nalternative docking solutions (atomic models) and then use a scoring function to \nselect the best. The success of the computational docking technique is, to a\nlarge degree, dependent on the ability of the scoring function to accurately rank\nand score the many alternative docking models.\nRESULTS: Here, we present ProQDock, a scoring function that predicts the absolute\nquality of docking model measured by a novel protein docking quality score\n(DockQ). ProQDock uses support vector machines trained to predict the quality of \nprotein docking models using features that can be calculated from the docking\nmodel itself. By combining different types of features describing both the\nprotein-protein interface and the overall physical chemistry, it was possible to \nimprove the correlation with DockQ from 0.25 for the best individual feature\n(electrostatic complementarity) to 0.49 for the final version of ProQDock.\nProQDock performed better than the state-of-the-art methods ZRANK and ZRANK2 in\nterms of correlations, ranking and finding correct models on an independent test \nset.

Not\nall scenarios are equally likely, and the same receptor sequence may be obtained \nin several different ways. Quantifying the distribution of these rearrangements\nis an essential baseline for studying the immune system diversity.

In many cases, evolution has blurred their repetitive\npatterns. This leads to the problem of distinguishing between sequences that\ncontain highly imperfect TRs, and the sequences without TRs. The 3D structure of \nproteins can be used as a benchmarking criterion for TR detection in sequences,\nbecause the vast majority of proteins having TRs in sequences are built of\nrepetitive 3D structural blocks. According to our benchmark, none of the existing\nscoring methods are able to clearly distinguish, based on the sequence analysis, \nbetween structures with and without 3D TRs.\nRESULTS: We developed a scoring tool called Tally, which is based on a machine\nlearning approach. Tally is able to achieve a better separation between sequences\nwith structural TRs and sequences of aperiodic structures, than existing scoring \nprocedures. It performs at a level of 81% sensitivity, while achieving a high\nspecificity of 74% and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve \nof 86%. Tally can be used to select a set of structurally and functionally\nmeaningful TRs from all TRs detected in proteomes.

Nowadays, with the great\nadvances in automated microscopic imaging, accurate bioimage-based classification\nmethods to predict protein subcellular locations are highly desired. All existing\nmodels were constructed on the independent parallel hypothesis, where the\ncellular component classes are positioned independently in a multi-class\nclassification engine. The important structural information of cellular\ncompartments is missed. To deal with this problem for developing more accurate\nmodels, we proposed a novel cell structure-driven classifier construction\napproach (SC-PSorter) by employing the prior biological structural information in\nthe learning model. Specifically, the structural relationship among the cellular \ncomponents is reflected by a new codeword matrix under the error correcting\noutput coding framework. Then, we construct multiple SC-PSorter-based classifiers\ncorresponding to the columns of the error correcting output coding codeword\nmatrix using a multi-kernel support vector machine classification approach.\nFinally, we perform the classifier ensemble by combining those multiple\nSC-PSorter-based classifiers via majority voting.\nRESULTS: We evaluate our method on a collection of 1636 immunohistochemistry\nimages from the Human Protein Atlas database.

Identifying single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) is important for quantification of methylation levels and\nfor study of allele-specific epigenetic events such as imprinting. However, SNP\ncalling in such data is complex and time consuming. Here, we present an ultrafast\nand memory-efficient package named BS-SNPer for the exploration of SNP sites from\nBS-Seq data. Compared with Bis-SNP, a popular BS-Seq specific SNP caller,\nBS-SNPer is over 100 times faster and uses less memory.

While the hypothesis that CGRs of\nmitochondrial DNA sequences can act as genomic signatures was validated for a\nsnapshot of all sequenced mitochondrial genomes available in the NCBI GenBank\nsequence database, to our knowledge no such extensive analysis of CGRs of nuclear\nDNA sequences exists to date.\nRESULTS: We analyzed an extensive dataset, totalling 1.45 gigabase pairs, of\nnuclear/nucleoid genomic sequences (nDNA) from 42 different organisms, spanning\nall major kingdoms of life. Our computational experiments indicate that CGR\nsignatures of nDNA of two different origins cannot always be differentiated,\nespecially if they originate from closely-related species such as H. sapiens and \nP. troglodytes or E. coli and E. fergusonii. To address this issue, we propose\nthe general concept of additive DNA signature of a set (collection) of DNA\nsequences. One particular instance, the composite DNA signature, combines\ninformation from nDNA fragments and organellar (mitochondrial, chloroplast, or\nplasmid) genomes. We demonstrate that, in this dataset, composite DNA signatures \noriginating from two different organisms can be differentiated in all cases,\nincluding those where the use of CGR signatures of nDNA failed or was\ninconclusive. Another instance, the assembled DNA signature, combines information\nfrom many short DNA subfragments (e.g., 100 basepairs) of a given DNA fragment,\nto produce its signature. We show that an assembled DNA signature has the same\ndistinguishing power as a conventionally computed CGR signature, while using\nshorter contiguous sequences and potentially less sequence information.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, while CGR signatures of nDNA cannot always\nplay the role of genomic signatures, composite and assembled DNA signatures\n(separately or in combination) could potentially be used instead. Such additive\nsignatures could be used, e.g., with raw unassembled next-generation sequencing\n(NGS) read data, when high-quality sequencing data is not available, or to\ncomplement information obtained by other methods of species identification or\nclassification.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1157-8 \nPMCID: PMC4994249\nPMID: 27549194  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

When cells undergo cellular respiration, they require \na pathway to keep and transfer electrons (i.e., the electron transport chain).\nDue to oxidation-reduction reactions, the electron transport chain produces a\ntransmembrane proton electrochemical gradient. In case protons flow back through \nthis membrane, this mechanical energy is converted into chemical energy by ATP\nsynthase. The convert process is involved in producing ATP which provides energy \nin a lot of cellular processes. In the electron transport chain process, flavin\nadenine dinucleotide (FAD) is one of the most vital molecules for carrying and\ntransferring electrons. Therefore, predicting FAD binding sites in the electron\ntransport chain is vital for helping biologists understand the electron transport\nchain process and energy production in cells.\nRESULTS: We used an independent data set to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed method, which had an accuracy of 69.84 %. We compared the performance of\nthe proposed method in analyzing two newly discovered electron transport protein \nsequences with that of the general FAD binding predictor presented by Mishra and \nRaghava and determined that the accuracy of the proposed method improved by\n9-45 % and its Matthew's correlation coefficient was 0.14-0.5. Furthermore, the\nproposed method enabled reducing the number of false positives significantly and \ncan provide useful information for biologists.\nCONCLUSIONS: We developed a method that is based on PSSM profiles and SAAPs for\nidentifying FAD binding sites in newly discovered electron transport protein\nsequences. This approach achieved a significant improvement after we added SAAPs \nto PSSM features to analyze FAD binding proteins in the electron transport chain.\nThe proposed method can serve as an effective tool for predicting FAD binding\nsites in electron transport proteins and can help biologists understand the\nfunctions of the electron transport chain, particularly those of FAD binding\nsites. We also developed a web server which identifies FAD binding sites in\nelectron transporters available for academics.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1163-x \nPMCID: PMC4967503\nPMID: 27475771  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Conceptually, these regions are divided into two\ncategories, narrow peaks and broad domains, and different algorithms are used to \nidentify each one. Datasets that span these two categories are often analyzed\nwith a single program for peak calling combined with an ad hoc method for\ndomains.\nRESULTS: We developed hiddenDomains, which identifies both peaks and domains, and\ncompare it to the leading algorithms using H3K27me3, H3K36me3, GABP, ESR1 and\nFOXA ChIP-seq datasets. The output from the programs was compared to\nqPCR-validated enriched and depleted sites, predicted transcription factor\nbinding sites, and highly-transcribed gene bodies. With every method,\nhiddenDomains, performed as well as, if not better than algorithms dedicated to a\nspecific type of analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: hiddenDomains performs as well as the best domain and peak calling\nalgorithms, making it ideal for analyzing ChIP-seq datasets, especially those\nthat contain a mixture of peaks and domains.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0991-z \nPMCID: PMC4806451\nPMID: 27009150  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Here we repurpose a\nhigh-throughput sequencing instrument to quantitatively measure binding and\ndissociation of a fluorescently labeled protein to >10(7) RNA targets generated\non a flow cell surface by in situ transcription and intermolecular tethering of\nRNA to DNA. Studying the MS2 coat protein, we decompose the binding energy\ncontributions from primary and secondary RNA structure, and observe that\ndifferences in affinity are often driven by sequence-specific changes in both\nassociation and dissociation rates. By analyzing the biophysical constraints and \nmodeling mutational paths describing the molecular evolution of MS2 from low- to \nhigh-affinity hairpins, we quantify widespread molecular epistasis and a\nlong-hypothesized, structure-dependent preference for G:U base pairs over C:A\nintermediates in evolutionary trajectories. Our results suggest that quantitative\nanalysis of RNA on a massively parallel array (RNA-MaP) provides generalizable\ninsight into the biophysical basis and evolutionary consequences of\nsequence-function relationships.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2880 \nPMCID: PMC4414031\nPMID: 24727714  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Recently, large-scale cancer genomic studies, such as The\nCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provide the opportunity to evaluate the predictive\nutility of molecular data for clinical drug responses in multiple cancer types.\nRESULTS: Here, we first curated the drug treatment information from TCGA. Four\nchemotherapeutic drugs had more than 180 clinical response records. Then, we\ndeveloped a computational framework to evaluate the molecule based predictions of\nclinical responses of the four drugs and to identify the corresponding molecular \nsignatures. Results show that mRNA or miRNA expressions can predict drug\nresponses significantly better than random classifiers in specific cancer types. \nA few signature genes are involved in drug response related pathways, such as\nDDB1 in DNA repair pathway and DLL4 in Notch signaling pathway. Finally, we\napplied the framework to predict responses across multiple cancer types and found\nthat the prediction performances get improved for cisplatin based on miRNA\nexpressions. Integrative analysis of clinical drug response data and molecular\ndata offers opportunities for discovering predictive markers in cancer. This\nstudy provides a starting point to objectively evaluate the molecule-based\npredictions of clinical drug responses.\nCONTACT: jgu@tsinghua.edu.cn\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

We reanalyzed the same datasets twice, using the same tools with\nthe same parameters, where we only altered the order of reads in the input (i.e. \nFASTQ file).

However, \nprevious computational methods fail to capture key nonlinear high-order\ndependencies between different amino acid positions. As a result, they often\nproduce low-quality rankings of strong binding peptides. To solve this problem,\nwe propose nonlinear high-order machine learning methods including high-order\nneural networks (HONNs) with possible deep extensions and high-order kernel\nsupport vector machines to predict major histocompatibility complex-peptide\nbinding.\nRESULTS: The proposed high-order methods improve quality of binding predictions\nover other prediction methods. With the proposed methods, a significant gain of\nup to 25-40% is observed on the benchmark and reference peptide datasets and\ntasks. In addition, for the first time, our experiments show that pre-training\nwith high-order semi-restricted Boltzmann machines significantly improves the\nperformance of feed-forward HONNs. Moreover, our experiments show that the\nproposed shallow HONN outperform the popular pre-trained deep neural network on\nmost tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of modelling high-order feature \ninteractions for predicting major histocompatibility complex-peptide binding.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: There is no associated distributable software.\nCONTACT: renqiang@nec-labs.com or mark.gerstein@yale.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

[2] Institute of Immunology, Charité Campus Buch, Berlin,\nGermany.\n\nIdentifying T-cell receptors (TCRs) that bind tumor-associated antigens (TAAs)\nwith optimal affinity is a key bottleneck in the development of adoptive T-cell\ntherapy of cancer. TAAs are unmutated self proteins, and T cells bearing\nhigh-affinity TCRs specific for such antigens are commonly deleted in the thymus.\nTo identify optimal-affinity TCRs, we generated antigen-negative humanized mice\nwith a diverse human TCR repertoire restricted to the human leukocyte antigen\n(HLA) A*02:01 (ref. 3). These mice were immunized with human TAAs, for which they\nare not tolerant, allowing induction of CD8⁺ T cells with optimal-affinity TCRs. \nWe isolate TCRs specific for the cancer/testis (CT) antigen MAGE-A1 (ref. 4) and \nshow that two of them have an anti-tumor effect in vivo. By comparison,\nhuman-derived TCRs have lower affinity and do not mediate substantial therapeutic\neffects. We also identify optimal-affinity TCRs specific for the CT antigen\nNY-ESO. Our humanized mouse model provides a useful tool for the generation of\noptimal-affinity TCRs for T-cell therapy.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3147 \nPMID: 25774714  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, for most C2H2-ZF proteins it is unknown\nwhether they even bind DNA or, if they do, to which sequences. Here, by combining\ndata from a modified bacterial one-hybrid system with protein-binding microarray \nand chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, we show that natural C2H2-ZFs encoded\nin the human genome bind DNA both in vitro and in vivo, and we infer the DNA\nrecognition code using DNA-binding data for thousands of natural C2H2-ZF domains.\nIn vivo binding data are generally consistent with our recognition code and\nindicate that C2H2-ZF proteins recognize more motifs than all other human\ntranscription factors combined. We provide direct evidence that most\nKRAB-containing C2H2-ZF proteins bind specific endogenous retroelements (EREs),\nranging from currently active to ancient families. The majority of C2H2-ZF\nproteins, including KRAB proteins, also show widespread binding to regulatory\nregions, indicating that the human genome contains an extensive and largely\nunstudied adaptive C2H2-ZF regulatory network that targets a diverse range of\ngenes and pathways.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3128 \nPMID: 25690854  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

This tool affords the opportunity to control neural activity over a\nbroad dynamic range of stimulation intensities. Using time-resolved activation,\nwe show that the neural control of male courtship song can be separated into (i) \nprobabilistic, persistent and (ii) deterministic, command-like components. The\nformer, but not the latter, neurons are subject to functional modulation by\nsocial experience, which supports the idea that they constitute a locus of\nstate-dependent influence. This separation is not evident using thermogenetic\ntools, a result underscoring the importance of temporally precise control of\nneuronal activation in the functional dissection of neural circuits in\nDrosophila.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2765 \nPMCID: PMC4151318\nPMID: 24363022  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We studied the key\nexperimental parameters to optimize performance of DNase-seq. Sequencing short\nfragments of 50-100 base pairs (bp) that accumulate in long internucleosome\nlinker regions was more efficient for identifying transcription factor binding\nsites compared to sequencing longer fragments. We also assessed the potential of \nDNase-seq to predict transcription factor occupancy via generation of\nnucleotide-resolution transcription factor footprints. In modeling the\nsequence-specific DNase I cutting bias, we found a strong effect that varied over\nmore than two orders of magnitude. This indicates that the nucleotide-resolution \ncleavage patterns at many transcription factor binding sites are derived from\nintrinsic DNase I cleavage bias rather than from specific protein-DNA\ninteractions. In contrast, quantitative comparison of DNase I hypersensitivity\nbetween states can predict transcription factor occupancy associated with\nparticular biological perturbations.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2762 \nPMCID: PMC4018771\nPMID: 24317252  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Multiple mechanisms of thermogeneration have been proposed, localized in\ndifferent subcellular organelles. However, visualizing thermogenesis directly in \nintact organelles has been challenging. Here we have developed genetically\nencoded, GFP-based thermosensors (tsGFPs) that enable visualization of\nthermogenesis in discrete organelles in living cells. In tsGFPs, a tandem\nformation of coiled-coil structures of the Salmonella thermosensing protein TlpA \ntransmits conformational changes to GFP to convert temperature changes into\nvisible and quantifiable fluorescence changes. Specific targeting of tsGFPs\nenables visualization of thermogenesis in the mitochondria of brown adipocytes\nand the endoplasmic reticulum of myotubes. In HeLa cells, tsGFP targeted to\nmitochondria reveals heterogeneity in thermogenesis that correlates with the\nelectrochemical gradient. Thus, tsGFPs are powerful tools to noninvasively assess\nthermogenesis in living cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2690 \nPMID: 24122038  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Recent studies have proposed several methods for\nRNA-seq of low-quality and/or low-quantity samples, but the relative merits of\nthese methods have not been systematically analyzed. Here we compare five such\nmethods using metrics relevant to transcriptome annotation, transcript discovery \nand gene expression. Using a single human RNA sample, we constructed and\nsequenced ten libraries with these methods and compared them against two control \nlibraries. We found that the RNase H method performed best for chemically\nfragmented, low-quality RNA, and we confirmed this through analysis of actual\ndegraded samples. RNase H can even effectively replace oligo(dT)-based methods\nfor standard RNA-seq. SMART and NuGEN had distinct strengths for measuring\nlow-quantity RNA. Our analysis allows biologists to select the most suitable\nmethods and provides a benchmark for future method development.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2483 \nPMCID: PMC3821180\nPMID: 23685885  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Previous\nresearch on risk factors for AD typically utilizes statistical comparison tests\nor stepwise selection with regression models. Outcomes of these methods tend to\nemphasize single risk factors rather than a combination of risk factors. However,\na combination of factors, rather than any one alone, is likely to affect disease \ndevelopment. Genetic algorithms (GA) can be useful and efficient for searching a \ncombination of variables for the best achievement (eg. accuracy of diagnosis),\nespecially when the search space is large, complex or poorly understood, as in\nthe case in prediction of AD development.\nRESULTS: Multiple sets of neuropsychological tests were identified by GA to best \npredict conversions between clinical categories, with a cross validated AUC (area\nunder the ROC curve) of 0.90 for prediction of HC conversion to MCI/AD and 0.86\nfor MCI conversion to AD within 36 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study showed the potential of GA application in the neural\nscience area. It demonstrated that the combination of a small set of variables is\nsuperior in performance than the use of all the single significant variables in\nthe model for prediction of progression of disease. Variables more frequently\nselected by GA might be more important as part of the algorithm for prediction of\ndisease development.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S11 \nPMCID: PMC4290638\nPMID: 25521394  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A cluster\nconsists of points falling into the basin of attraction of an estimated mode of\nthe underlining density function. A post-processing step merges clusters and\ngenerates a hierarchical cluster tree. The number of clusters is selected from\nthe most stable clustering in the hierarchical cluster tree. Experimental results\non ten synthetic benchmark datasets and two microarray gene expression datasets\ndemonstrate that densityCut performs better than state-of-the-art algorithms for \nclustering biological datasets. For applications, we focus on the recent cancer\nmutation clustering and single cell data analyses, namely to cluster variant\nallele frequencies of somatic mutations to reveal clonal architectures of\nindividual tumours, to cluster single-cell gene expression data to uncover cell\npopulation compositions, and to cluster single-cell mass cytometry data to detect\ncommunities of cells of the same functional states or types. densityCut performs \nbetter than competing algorithms and is scalable to large datasets.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Data and the densityCut R package is available\nfrom https://bitbucket.org/jerry00/densitycut_dev\nCONTACT: : condon@cs.ubc.ca or sshah@bccrc.ca or jiaruid@cs.ubc.ca\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Inaccurate\nassignments of peptide identification confidence thus may have far-reaching and\nadverse consequences. Although some peptide identification methods report\naccurate statistics, they have been limited to certain types of scoring function.\nThe extreme value statistics based method, while more general in the scoring\nfunctions it allows, demands accurate parameter estimates and requires, at least \nin its original design, excessive computational resources. Improving the\nparameter estimate accuracy and reducing the computational cost for this method\nhas two advantages: it provides another feasible route to accurate significance\nassessment, and it could provide reliable statistics for scoring functions yet to\nbe developed.\nRESULTS: We have formulated and implemented an efficient algorithm for\ncalculating the extreme value statistics for peptide identification applicable to\nvarious scoring functions, bypassing the need for searching large random\ndatabases.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code, implemented in C ++ on a linux \nsystem, is available for download at\nftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/qmbp/qmbp_ms/RAId/RAId_Linux_64Bit\nCONTACT: yyu@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\nPublished by Oxford University Press 2016.

Moreover, obtaining all-atom 3D structures of membrane\nproteins is also technically difficult, and many of the available data are either\nexperimental low-resolution structures or theoretical models, whose structural\nquality needs to be evaluated. Here, to address these two crucial problems, we\npropose OREMPRO, a web server capable of both (i) positioning α-helical and\nβ-sheet transmembrane domains in the lipid bilayer and (ii) assessing their\nstructural quality. Most importantly, OREMPRO uses the sole alpha carbon\ncoordinates, which makes it the only web server compatible with both high and low\nstructural resolutions.

Various defence mechanisms \nhave explained the regulation of plant immunity, but still, we have limited\nunderstanding about plant defence against different pathogens.

(3)Turing Ate My Hamster Ltd., Newcastle upon Tyne,\nUK.\n\nMOTIVATION: Biological systems are complex and challenging to model and therefore\nmodel reuse is highly desirable. To promote model reuse, models should include\nboth information about the specifics of simulations and the underlying biology in\nthe form of metadata. The availability of computationally tractable metadata is\nespecially important for the effective automated interpretation and processing of\nmodels. Metadata are typically represented as machine-readable annotations which \nenhance programmatic access to information about models. Rule-based languages\nhave emerged as a modelling framework to represent the complexity of biological\nsystems. Annotation approaches have been widely used for reaction-based\nformalisms such as SBML. However, rule-based languages still lack a rich\nannotation framework to add semantic information, such as machine-readable\ndescriptions, to the components of a model.\nRESULTS: We present an annotation framework and guidelines for annotating\nrule-based models, encoded in the commonly used Kappa and BioNetGen languages. We\nadapt widely adopted annotation approaches to rule-based models. We initially\npropose a syntax to store machine-readable annotations and describe a mapping\nbetween rule-based modelling entities, such as agents and rules, and their\nannotations. We then describe an ontology to both annotate these models and\ncapture the information contained therein, and demonstrate annotating these\nmodels using examples. Finally, we present a proof of concept tool for extracting\nannotations from a model that can be queried and analyzed in a uniform way. The\nuniform representation of the annotations can be used to facilitate the creation,\nanalysis, reuse and visualization of rule-based models. Although examples are\ngiven, using specific implementations the proposed techniques can be applied to\nrule-based models in general.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The annotation ontology for rule-based models\ncan be found at http://purl.org/rbm/rbmo The krdf tool and associated executable \nexamples are available at http://purl.org/rbm/rbmo/krdf\nCONTACT: anil.wipat@newcastle.ac.uk or vdanos@inf.ed.ac.uk.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Due to the infiltration of tumor surrounding normal cells, the\nexpression data derived from tumor samples would always be contaminated with\nnormal cells. Ignoring such cellular contamination would deflate the power of\ndetecting DE genes and further confound the biological interpretation of the\nanalysis results. For the time being, there does not exists any differential\nexpression analysis approach for RNA-seq data in literature that can properly\naccount for the contamination of tumor samples.\nRESULTS: Without appealing to any extra information, we develop a new method\n'contamDE' based on a novel statistical model that associates RNA-seq expression \nlevels with cell types. It is demonstrated through simulation studies that\ncontamDE could be much more powerful than the existing methods that ignore the\ncontamination.

All of the original Cellerator arrows, which represent reactions\nranging from mass action, Michales-Menten-Henri (MMH) and Gene-Regulation (GRN)\nto Monod-Wyman-Changeaux (MWC), user defined reactions and enzymatic expansions\n(KMech), were previously represented with the Mathematica extended character set.\nThese are now typed as reaction-like commands in ASCII text files that are read\nby Pycellerator, which includes a Python command line interface (CLI), a Python\napplication programming interface (API) and an iPython notebook interface.\nRESULTS: Cellerator reaction arrows are now input in text files. The arrows are\nparsed by Pycellerator and translated into differential equations in Python, and \nPython code is automatically generated to solve the system. Time courses are\nproduced by executing the auto-generated Python code. Users have full freedom to \nmodify the solver and utilize the complete set of standard Python tools. The new \nlibraries are completely independent of the old Cellerator software and do not\nrequire Mathematica.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All software is available (GPL) from the github \nrepository at https://github.com/biomathman/pycellerator/releases.

Thus being able to interpret the functional consequence of a variant is\nessential for identifying causal variants in the analysis of genome-wide\nassociation studies.\nRESULTS: We present GERV (generative evaluation of regulatory variants), a novel \ncomputational method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription\nfactor binding. GERV learns a k-mer-based generative model of transcription\nfactor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data, and scores variants by computing\nthe change of predicted ChIP-seq reads between the reference and alternate\nallele. The k-mers learned by GERV capture more sequence determinants of\ntranscription factor binding than a motif-based approach alone, including both a \ntranscription factor's canonical motif and associated co-factor motifs. We show\nthat GERV outperforms existing methods in predicting single-nucleotide\npolymorphisms associated with allele-specific binding. GERV correctly predicts a \nvalidated causal variant among linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms and\nprioritizes the variants previously reported to modulate the binding of FOXA1 in \nbreast cancer cell lines. Thus, GERV provides a powerful approach for\nfunctionally annotating and prioritizing causal variants for experimental\nfollow-up analysis.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation of GERV and related data are \navailable at http://gerv.csail.mit.edu/.\n\n© The Author 2015.

Particularly relevant is the\nstudy of the Relative Species Abundance (RSA) distribution, that is a component\nof biodiversity and measures the number of species having a given number of\nindividuals. It is the universal behaviour of RSA that induced many ecologists to\nlook for theoretical explanations. In particular, a simple stochastic neutral\nmodel was proposed by Volkov et al. relying on population dynamics and was proved\nto fit the coral-reefs and rain forests RSA. Our aim is to ascertain if this\nmodel also describes the Microbiota RSA and if it can help in explaining the\nMicrobiota plasticity.\nRESULTS: We analyzed 16S rRNA sequencing data sampled from the Microbiota of\nthree different animal species by Jeraldo et al. Through a clustering procedure\n(UCLUST), we built the Operational Taxonomic Units. These correspond to bacterial\nspecies considered at a given phylogenetic level defined by the similarity\nthreshold used in the clustering procedure. The RSAs, plotted in the form of\nPreston plot, were fitted with Volkov's model. The model fits well the Microbiota\nRSA, except in the tail region, that shows a deviation from the neutrality\nassumption. Looking at the model parameters we were able to discriminate between \ndifferent animal species, giving also a biological explanation. Moreover, the\nbiodiversity estimator obtained by Volkov's model also differentiates the animal \nspecies and is in good agreement with the first and second order Hill's numbers, \nthat are common evenness indexes simply based on the fraction of individuals per \nspecies.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the neutrality assumption is a good approximation\nfor the Microbiota dynamics and the observation that Volkov's model works for\nthis ecosystem is a further proof of the RSA universality. Moreover, the ability \nto separate different animals with the model parameters and biodiversity number\nare promising results if we think about future applications on human data, in\nwhich the Microbiota composition and biodiversity are in close relationships with\na variety of diseases and life-styles.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0858-8 \nPMCID: PMC4959352\nPMID: 26821617  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

With increasing\nresolution of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) arrays, more\nand more raw copy number data are collected for multiple arrays. It is natural to\nrealize the co-existence of both recurrent and individual-specific CNVs, together\nwith the possible data contamination during the data generation process.\nTherefore, there is a great need for an efficient and robust statistical model\nfor simultaneous recovery of both recurrent and individual-specific CNVs.\nRESULT: We develop a penalized weighted low-rank approximation method (WPLA) for \nrobust recovery of recurrent CNVs. In particular, we formulate multiple aCGH\narrays into a realization of a hidden low-rank matrix with some random noises and\nlet an additional weight matrix account for those individual-specific effects.\nThus, we do not restrict the random noise to be normally distributed, or even\nhomogeneous. We show its performance through three real datasets and twelve\nsynthetic datasets from different types of recurrent CNV regions associated with \neither normal random errors or heavily contaminated errors.\nCONCLUSION: Our numerical experiments have demonstrated that the WPLA can\nsuccessfully recover the recurrent CNV patterns from raw data under different\nscenarios. Compared with two other recent methods, it performs the best regarding\nits ability to simultaneously detect both recurrent and individual-specific CNVs \nunder normal random errors. More importantly, the WPLA is the only method which\ncan effectively recover the recurrent CNVs region when the data is heavily\ncontaminated.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0835-2 \nPMCID: PMC4676147\nPMID: 26652207  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The development of reliable classifiers requires tackling\nseveral crucial aspects, some of which have been widely overlooked in the\nscientific literature: the distribution of the measured miRNA expressions and the\nstatistical uncertainty that affects the parameters that characterize a\nclassifier. In this paper, these topics are analysed in detail by discussing a\nmodel problem, i.e. the development of a Bayesian classifier that, on the basis\nof the expression of miR-205, miR-21 and snRNA U6, discriminates samples into two\nclasses of pulmonary tumors: adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.\nRESULTS: We proved that the variance of miRNA expression triplicates is well\ndescribed by a normal distribution and that triplicate averages also follow\nnormal distributions. We provide a method to enhance a classifiers' performance\nby exploiting the correlations between the class-discriminating miRNA and the\nexpression of an additional normalized miRNA.\nCONCLUSIONS: By exploiting the normal behavior of triplicate variances and\naverages, invalid samples (outliers) can be identified by checking their\nvariability via chi-square test or their displacement by the respective\npopulation mean via Student's t-test. Finally, the normal behavior allows to\noptimally set the Bayesian classifier and to determine its performance and the\nrelated uncertainty.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0715-9 \nPMCID: PMC4559882\nPMID: 26338526  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Biological systems\nare inherently multiscale, from molecules to tissues and from nano-seconds to a\nlifespan of several years or decades. ENISI MSM integrates multiple modeling\ntechnologies to understand immunological processes from signaling pathways within\ncells to lesion formation at the tissue level. This paper examines and summarizes\nthe technical details of ENISI, from its initial version to its latest\ncutting-edge implementation.\nIMPLEMENTATION: Object-oriented programming approach is adopted to develop a\nsuite of tools based on ENISI.

Our modeling predictions dissect\nthe mechanisms by which effector CD4+ T cell responses contribute to tissue\ndamage in the gut mucosa following immune dysregulation.Computational modeling\ntechniques are playing increasingly important roles in advancing a systems-level \nmechanistic understanding of biological processes.

This study presents ENteric Immune\nSimulator (ENISI), a multiscale modeling tool for modeling the mucosal immune\nresponses.

Two crucial steps that affect RNA-Seq experiment\nresults are Library Sample Preparation (LSP) and Bioinformatics Analysis (BA).\nThis work describes an evaluation of the combined effect of LSP methods and BA\ntools in the detection of splice variants.\nRESULTS: Different LSPs (TruSeq unstranded/stranded, ScriptSeq, NuGEN) allowed\nthe detection of a large common set of splice variants. However, each LSP also\ndetected a small set of unique transcripts that are characterized by a low\ncoverage and/or FPKM. This effect was particularly evident using the low input\nRNA NuGEN v2 protocol. A benchmark dataset, in which synthetic reads as well as\nreads generated from standard (Illumina TruSeq 100) and low input (NuGEN) LSPs\nwere spiked-in was used to evaluate the effect of LSP on the statistical\ndetection of alternative splicing events (AltDE). Statistical detection of AltDE \nwas done using as prototypes for splice variant-quantification Cuffdiff2 and\nRSEM-EBSeq. As prototype for exon-level analysis DEXSeq was used. Exon-level\nanalysis performed slightly better than splice variant-quantification approaches,\nalthough at most only 50% of the spiked-in transcripts was detected. The\nperformances of both splice variant-quantification and exon-level analysis\nimproved when raising the number of input reads.\nCONCLUSION: Data, derived from NuGEN v2, were not the ideal input for AltDE,\nespecially when the exon-level approach was used. We observed that both splice\nvariant-quantification and exon-level analysis performances were strongly\ndependent on the number of input reads. Moreover, the ribosomal RNA depletion\nprotocol was less sensitive in detecting splicing variants, possibly due to the\nsignificant percentage of the reads mapping to non-coding transcripts.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S9-S2 \nPMCID: PMC4464605\nPMID: 26050971  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The recently proposed binarisation of consensus partition \nmatrices (Bi-CoPaM) method can combine clustering results from multiple datasets \nto identify the subsets of genes which are consistently co-expressed in all of\nthe provided datasets in a tuneable manner. However, results validation and\nparameter setting are issues that complicate the design of such methods.\nMoreover, although it is a common practice to test methods by application to\nsynthetic datasets, the mathematical models used to synthesise such datasets are \nusually based on approximations which may not always be sufficiently\nrepresentative of real datasets.\nRESULTS: Here, we propose an unsupervised method for the unification of\nclustering results from multiple datasets using external specifications (UNCLES).\nThis method has the ability to identify the subsets of genes consistently\nco-expressed in a subset of datasets while being poorly co-expressed in another\nsubset of datasets, and to identify the subsets of genes consistently\nco-expressed in all given datasets. We also propose the M-N scatter plots\nvalidation technique and adopt it to set the parameters of UNCLES, such as the\nnumber of clusters, automatically. Additionally, we propose an approach for the\nsynthesis of gene expression datasets using real data profiles in a way which\ncombines the ground-truth-knowledge of synthetic data and the realistic\nexpression values of real data, and therefore overcomes the problem of\nfaithfulness of synthetic expression data modelling. By application to those\ndatasets, we validate UNCLES while comparing it with other conventional\nclustering methods, and of particular relevance, biclustering methods. We further\nvalidate UNCLES by application to a set of 14 real genome-wide yeast datasets as \nit produces focused clusters that conform well to known biological facts.\nFurthermore, in-silico-based hypotheses regarding the function of a few\npreviously unknown genes in those focused clusters are drawn.\nCONCLUSIONS: The UNCLES method, the M-N scatter plots technique, and the\nexpression data synthesis approach will have wide application for the\ncomprehensive analysis of genomic and other sources of multiple complex\nbiological datasets. Moreover, the derived in-silico-based biological hypotheses \nrepresent subjects for future functional studies.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0614-0 \nPMCID: PMC4453228\nPMID: 26040489  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the standard terminology in such\ncollections suffers from low usage in biomedical literature, e.g. only 13% of\nUMLS terms appear in MEDLINE.\nRESULTS: We here propose an efficient and effective method for extracting noun\nphrases for biomedical semantic categories. The proposed approach utilizes simple\nlinguistic patterns to select candidate noun phrases based on headwords, and a\nmachine learning classifier is used to filter out noisy phrases. For experiments,\nthree NLP rules were tested and manually evaluated by three annotators. Our\napproaches showed over 93% precision on average for the headwords, \"gene\",\n\"protein\", \"disease\", \"cell\" and \"cells\".\nCONCLUSIONS: Although biomedical terms in knowledge-rich resources may define\nsemantic categories, variations of the controlled terms in literature are still\ndifficult to identify. The method proposed here is an effort to narrow the gap\nbetween controlled vocabularies and the entities used in text. Our extraction\nmethod cannot completely eliminate manual evaluation, however a simple and\nautomated solution with high precision performance provides a convenient way for \nenriching semantic categories by incorporating terms obtained from the\nliterature.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0487-2 \nPMCID: PMC4349776\nPMID: 25887671  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Although many algorithms exist for the identification and\nlocalization of molecules from raw image data, methods for analyzing the\nresulting point patterns for properties such as clustering have remained\nrelatively under-studied. Here we present a model-based Bayesian approach to\nevaluate molecular cluster assignment proposals, generated in this study by\nanalysis based on Ripley's K function. The method takes full account of the\nindividual localization precisions calculated for each emitter. We validate the\napproach using simulated data, as well as experimental data on the clustering\nbehavior of CD3ζ, a subunit of the CD3 T cell receptor complex, in resting and\nactivated primary human T cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3612 \nPMID: 26436479  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A dense, full-view tomographic data set is a set of\nimages of a cell acquired for multiple rotational positions, densely distributed \nfrom 0 to 360 degrees. The reconstruction is commonly realized by projection\ntomography, which is based on the inversion of the Radon transform. The\nreconstruction quality of projection tomography is greatly improved when first\norder scattering, which becomes relevant when the imaging wavelength is\ncomparable to the characteristic object size, is taken into account. This\nadvanced reconstruction technique is called diffraction tomography. While many\nimplementations of projection tomography are available today, there is no\npublicly available implementation of diffraction tomography so far.\nRESULTS: We present a Python library that implements the backpropagation\nalgorithm for diffraction tomography in 3D. By establishing benchmarks based on\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, we showcase the superiority of \nthe backpropagation algorithm over the backprojection algorithm. Furthermore, we \ndiscuss how measurment parameters influence the reconstructed refractive index\ndistribution and we also give insights into the applicability of diffraction\ntomography to biological cells.\nCONCLUSION: The present software library contains a robust implementation of the \nbackpropagation algorithm. The algorithm is ideally suited for the application to\nbiological cells. Furthermore, the implementation is a drop-in replacement for\nthe classical backprojection algorithm and is made available to the large user\ncommunity of the Python programming language.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0764-0 \nPMCID: PMC4634917\nPMID: 26537417  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epub\n2015 Sep 25.\n\nDynamical modeling of uncertain interaction-based genomic networks.\n\nMohsenizadeh DN, Hua J, Bittner M, Dougherty ER.\n\nBACKGROUND: Most dynamical models for genomic networks are built upon two current\nmethodologies, one process-based and the other based on Boolean-type networks.\nBoth are problematic when it comes to experimental design purposes in the\nlaboratory. The first approach requires a comprehensive knowledge of the\nparameters involved in all biological processes a priori, whereas the results\nfrom the second method may not have a biological correspondence and thus cannot\nbe tested in the laboratory. Moreover, the current methods cannot readily utilize\nexisting curated knowledge databases and do not consider uncertainty in the\nknowledge. Therefore, a new methodology is needed that can generate a dynamical\nmodel based on available biological data, assuming uncertainty, while the results\nfrom experimental design can be examined in the laboratory.\nRESULTS: We propose a new methodology for dynamical modeling of genomic networks \nthat can utilize the interaction knowledge provided in public databases. The\nmodel assigns discrete states for physical entities, sets priorities among\ninteractions based on information provided in the database, and updates each\ninteraction based on associated node states. Whenever uncertainty in dynamics\narises, it explores all possible outcomes. By using the proposed model,\nbiologists can study regulation networks that are too complex for manual\nanalysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach can be effectively used for constructing\ndynamical models of interaction-based genomic networks without requiring a\ncomplete knowledge of all parameters affecting the network dynamics, and thus\nbased on a small set of available data.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S13-S3 \nPMCID: PMC4596957\nPMID: 26423606  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Thus, encountering environmental changes, including\ntemperature stresses, is common during the mass production of Spirulina. The use \nof cyanobacteria as an experimental platform, especially for photosynthetic gene \nmanipulation in plants and bacteria, is becoming increasingly important.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms and protein-protein interaction networks that\nunderlie low- and high-temperature responses is relevant to Spirulina mass\nproduction. To accomplish this goal, high-throughput techniques such as OMICs\nanalyses are used. Thus, large datasets must be collected, managed and subjected \nto information extraction. Therefore, databases including (i) proteomic analysis \nand protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and (ii) domain/motif visualization\ntools are required for potential use in temperature response models for plant\nchloroplasts and photosynthetic bacteria.\nDESCRIPTIONS: A web-based repository was developed including an embedded\ndatabase, SpirPro, and tools for network visualization. Proteome data were\nanalyzed integrated with protein-protein interactions and/or metabolic pathways\nfrom KEGG. The repository provides various information, ranging from raw data\n(2D-gel images) to associated results, such as data from interaction and/or\npathway analyses. This integration allows in silico analyses of protein-protein\ninteractions affected at the metabolic level and, particularly, analyses of\ninteractions between and within the affected metabolic pathways under temperature\nstresses for comparative proteomic analysis. The developed tool, which is coded\nin HTML with CSS/JavaScript and depicted in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), is\ndesigned for interactive analysis and exploration of the constructed network.\nSpirPro is publicly available on the web at http://spirpro.sbi.kmutt.ac.th .\nCONCLUSIONS: SpirPro is an analysis platform containing an integrated proteome\nand PPI database that provides the most comprehensive data on this cyanobacterium\nat the systematic level. As an integrated database, SpirPro can be applied in\nvarious analyses, such as temperature stress response networking analysis in\ncyanobacterial models and interacting domain-domain analysis between proteins of \ninterest.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0676-z \nPMCID: PMC4518644\nPMID: 26220682  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Just as GIS indexes items or events based on their\nspatio-temporal or 4D location on the Earth these tools would organize knowledge \nbased on location within the tissues or embryos. Developmental processes are\nhighly context-specific, but the complexity of the 4D environment in which they\nunfold is a barrier to assembling an understanding of any particular process from\ndiverse sources of information. In the same way that GIS aids the understanding\nand use of geo-located large data sets, software can, with a proper frame of\nreference, allow large biological data sets to be understood spatially. Intuitive\ntools are needed to navigate the spatial structure of complex tissue, collate\nlarge data sets and existing knowledge with this spatial structure and help users\nderive hypotheses about developmental mechanisms.\nRESULTS: Toward this goal we have developed WormGUIDES, a mobile application that\npresents a 4D developmental atlas for Caenorhabditis elegans. The WormGUIDES\nmobile app enables users to navigate a 3D model depicting the nuclear positions\nof all cells in the developing embryo. The identity of each cell can be queried\nwith a tap, and community databases searched for available information about that\ncell. Information about ancestry, fate and gene expression can be used to label\ncells and craft customized visualizations that highlight cells as potential\nplayers in an event of interest. Scenes are easily saved, shared and published to\nother WormGUIDES users. The mobile app is available for Android and iOS\nplatforms.\nCONCLUSION: WormGUIDES provides an important tool for examining developmental\nprocesses and developing mechanistic hypotheses about their control. Critically, \nit provides the typical end user with an intuitive interface for developing and\nsharing custom visualizations of developmental processes. Equally important,\nbecause users can select cells based on their position and search for information\nabout them, the app also serves as a spatially organized index into the large\nbody of knowledge available to the C. elegans community online. Moreover, the app\ncan be used to create and publish the result of exploration: interactive content \nthat brings other researchers and students directly to the spatio-temporal point \nof insight. Ultimately the app will incorporate a detailed time lapse record of\ncell shape, beginning with neurons. This will add the key ability to navigate and\nunderstand the developmental events that result in the coordinated and precise\nemergence of anatomy, particularly the wiring of the nervous system.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0627-8 \nPMCID: PMC4459063\nPMID: 26051157  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Transposition events associated with\nphenotypic changes occur naturally or are induced in insertional mutant\npopulations. Transposon mutagenesis results in multiple random insertions and\nrecovery of most/all the insertions is critical for forward genetics study. Using\ngenome next-generation sequencing data and appropriate bioinformatics tool, it is\nplausible to accurately identify transposon insertion sites, which could provide \ncandidate causal mutations for desired phenotypes for further functional\nvalidation.\nRESULTS: We developed a novel bioinformatics tool, ITIS (Identification of\nTransposon Insertion Sites), for localizing transposon insertion sites within a\ngenome. It takes next-generation genome re-sequencing data (NGS data), transposon\nsequence, and reference genome sequence as input, and generates a list of highly \nreliable candidate insertion sites as well as zygosity information of each\ninsertion. Using a simulated dataset and a case study based on an insertional\nmutant line from Medicago truncatula, we showed that ITIS performed better in\nterms of sensitivity and specificity than other similar algorithms such as\nRelocaTE, RetroSeq, TEMP and TIF. With the case study data, we demonstrated the\nefficiency of ITIS by validating the presence and zygosity of predicted insertion\nsites of the Tnt1 transposon within a complex plant system, M. truncatula.\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that ITIS is a robust and powerful tool for forward\ngenetic studies in identifying transposable element insertions causing\nphenotypes. ITIS is suitable in various systems such as cell culture, bacteria,\nyeast, insect, mammal and plant.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0507-2 \nPMCID: PMC4351942\nPMID: 25887332  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

ASE\ntesting is implemented through binomial or beta-binomial tests of sequence read\ncounts of alternative alleles at a cSNP of interest in heterozygous individuals. \nThis requires prior ascertainment of the cSNP genotypes for all individuals. To\nmeet the needs, we propose hidden Markov methods to call SNPs from next\ngeneration RNA sequence data when ASE possibly exists.\nRESULTS: We propose two hidden Markov models (HMMs), HMM-ASE and HMM-NASE that\nconsider or do not consider ASE, respectively, in order to improve genotyping\naccuracy. Both HMMs have the advantages of calling the genotypes of several SNPs \nsimultaneously and allow mapping error which, respectively, utilize the\ndependence among SNPs and correct the bias due to mapping error. In addition,\nHMM-ASE exploits ASE information to further improve genotype accuracy when the\nASE is likely to be present. Simulation results indicate that the HMMs proposed\ndemonstrate a very good prediction accuracy in terms of controlling both the\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) and the false negative rate (FNR). When ASE is\npresent, the HMM-ASE had a lower FNR than HMM-NASE, while both can control the\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) at a similar level. By exploiting linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD), a real data application demonstrate that the proposed\nmethods have better sensitivity and similar FDR in calling heterozygous SNPs than\nthe VarScan method. Sensitivity and FDR are similar to that of the BCFtools and\nBeagle methods. The resulting genotypes show good properties for the estimation\nof the genetic parameters and ASE ratios.\nCONCLUSIONS: We introduce HMMs, which are able to exploit LD and account for the \nASE and mapping errors, to simultaneously call SNPs from the next generation RNA \nsequence data. The method introduced can reliably call for cSNP genotypes even in\nthe presence of ASE and under low sequencing coverage. As a byproduct, the\nproposed method is able to provide predictions of ASE ratios for the heterozygous\ngenotypes, which can then be used for ASE testing.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0479-2 \nPMCID: PMC4351697\nPMID: 25887316  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A\nchange in stability may subsequently lead to dysfunction and finally cause\ndiseases. Moreover, protein engineering approaches aim to deliberately modify\nprotein properties, where stability is a major constraint. In order to support\nbasic research and protein design tasks, several computational tools for\npredicting the change in stability upon mutations have been developed.\nComparative studies have shown the usefulness but also limitations of such\nprograms.\nRESULTS: We aim to contribute a novel method for predicting changes in stability \nupon point mutation in proteins called MAESTRO. MAESTRO is structure based and\ndistinguishes itself from similar approaches in the following points: (i) MAESTRO\nimplements a multi-agent machine learning system. (ii) It also provides predicted\nfree energy change (Δ ΔG) values and a corresponding prediction confidence\nestimation. (iii) It provides high throughput scanning for multi-point mutations \nwhere sites and types of mutation can be comprehensively controlled.

Abundantly available\nproteins in spots can be identified using mass spectrometry-based approaches.\nHowever, identification is often not possible for low-abundant proteins.\nRESULTS: We present a novel computational approach to prioritize candidate\nproteins for unidentified spots. Our approach exploits noisy information on the\nisoelectric point and apparent molecular mass of a protein spot in combination\nwith functional similarities of candidate proteins to already identified proteins\nto select and rank candidates. We evaluated our method on a 2D-DIGE dataset\ncomparing protein expression in uninfected and HIV-1 infected T-cells. Using\nleave-one-out cross-validation, we show that the true-positive rate for the top-5\nranked proteins is 43.8%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our approach shows good performance on a 2D-DIGE dataset comparing\nprotein expression in uninfected and HIV-1 infected T-cells. We expect our method\nto be highly useful in (re-)mining other 2D-DIGE experiments in which especially \nthe low-abundant protein spots remain to be identified.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0455-x \nPMCID: PMC4384356\nPMID: 25627479  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

These errors make sequence assembly and other downstream \nprojects more challenging. Correcting these errors improves the quality of\nassemblies and projects which benefit from error-free reads.\nRESULTS: We have developed a general-purpose error corrector that corrects errors\nintroduced by Illumina, Ion Torrent, and Roche 454 sequencing technologies and\ncan be applied to single- or mixed-genome data. In addition to correcting\nsubstitution errors, we locate and correct insertion, deletion, and homopolymer\nerrors while remaining sensitive to low coverage areas of sequencing projects.\nUsing published data sets, we correct 94% of Illumina MiSeq errors, 88% of Ion\nTorrent PGM errors, 85% of Roche 454 GS Junior errors. Introduced errors are 20\nto 70 times more rare than successfully corrected errors. Furthermore, we show\nthat the quality of assemblies improves when reads are corrected by our software.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pollux is highly effective at correcting errors across platforms,\nand is consistently able to perform as well or better than currently available\nerror correction software. Pollux provides general-purpose error correction and\nmay be used in applications with or without assembly.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0435-6 \nPMCID: PMC4307147\nPMID: 25592313  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The biology of\nindividual cells provide valuable information, thus the separation of touching\ncells in these microscopy images is critical for counting, identification and\nmeasurement of individual cells. Over-segmentation of single cells continues to\nbe a major problem for methods based on morphological watershed due to the high\nlevel of noise in microscopy cell images. There is a need for a new segmentation \nmethod that is robust over a wide variety of biological images and can accurately\nseparate individual cells even in challenging datasets such as confluent sheets\nor colonies.\nRESULTS: We present a new automated segmentation method called FogBank that\naccurately separates cells when confluent and touching each other. This technique\nis successfully applied to phase contrast, bright field, fluorescence microscopy \nand binary images. The method is based on morphological watershed principles with\ntwo new features to improve accuracy and minimize over-segmentation. First,\nFogBank uses histogram binning to quantize pixel intensities which minimizes the \nimage noise that causes over-segmentation. Second, FogBank uses a geodesic\ndistance mask derived from raw images to detect the shapes of individual cells,\nin contrast to the more linear cell edges that other watershed-like algorithms\nproduce. We evaluated the segmentation accuracy against manually segmented\ndatasets using two metrics. FogBank achieved segmentation accuracy on the order\nof 0.75 (1 being a perfect match). We compared our method with other available\nsegmentation techniques in term of achieved performance over the reference data\nsets. FogBank outperformed all related algorithms. The accuracy has also been\nvisually verified on data sets with 14 cell lines across 3 imaging modalities\nleading to 876 segmentation evaluation images.\nCONCLUSIONS: FogBank produces single cell segmentation from confluent cell sheets\nwith high accuracy. It can be applied to microscopy images of multiple cell lines\nand a variety of imaging modalities. The code for the segmentation method is\navailable as open-source and includes a Graphical User Interface for user\nfriendly execution.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0431-x \nPMCID: PMC4301455\nPMID: 25547324  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we present targeted locus amplification (TLA), a\nstrategy to selectively amplify and sequence entire genes on the basis of the\ncrosslinking of physically proximal sequences. We show that, unlike other\ntargeted re-sequencing methods, TLA works without detailed prior locus\ninformation, as one or a few primer pairs are sufficient for sequencing tens to\nhundreds of kilobases of surrounding DNA. This enables robust detection of single\nnucleotide variants, structural variants and gene fusions in clinically relevant \ngenes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, and enables haplotyping. We show that TLA can\nalso be used to uncover insertion sites and sequences of integrated transgenes\nand viruses. TLA therefore promises to be a useful method in genetic research and\ndiagnostics when comprehensive or allele-specific genetic information is needed.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2959 \nPMID: 25129690  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Each TCR is a heterodimer, and both α- and\nβ-chains contribute to determining TCR antigen specificity. Here we present a\nmethodology enabling integration of information about TCR specificity with\ninformation about T cell function. This method involves sequencing of TCRα and\nTCRβ genes, and amplifying functional genes characteristic of different T cell\nsubsets, in single T cells. Because this approach retains information about\nindividual TCRα-TCRβ pairs, TCRs of interest can be expressed and used in\nfunctional studies, for antigen discovery, or in therapeutic applications. We\napply this approach to study the clonal ancestry and differentiation of T\nlymphocytes infiltrating a human colorectal carcinoma.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.2938 \nPMCID: PMC4337815\nPMID: 24952902  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

GFE3 is a fusion \nbetween an E3 ligase, which mediates the ubiquitination and rapid degradation of \nproteins, and a recombinant, antibody-like protein (FingR) that binds to\ngephyrin. Expression of GFE3 leads to a strong and specific reduction of gephyrin\nin culture or in vivo and to a substantial decrease in phasic inhibition onto\ncells that express GFE3. By temporarily expressing GFE3 we showed that inhibitory\nsynapses regrow following ablation. Thus, we have created a simple, reversible\nmethod for modulating inhibitory synaptic input onto genetically determined\ncells.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3894 \nPMID: 27271196  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

In contrast, molecular phenotype data, such as gene\nexpression levels, are generally assumed to be free of such identifying\ninformation. Although there is no explicit genotypic information in phenotype\ndata, adversaries can statistically link phenotypes to genotypes using publicly\navailable genotype-phenotype correlations such as expression quantitative trait\nloci (eQTLs). This linking can be accurate when high-dimensional data (i.e., many\nexpression levels) are used, and the resulting links can then reveal sensitive\ninformation (for example, the fact that an individual has cancer). Here we\ndevelop frameworks for quantifying the leakage of characterizing information from\nphenotype data sets. These frameworks can be used to estimate the leakage from\nlarge data sets before release. We also present a general three-step procedure\nfor practically instantiating linking attacks and a specific attack using outlier\ngene expression levels that is simple yet accurate. Finally, we describe the\neffectiveness of this outlier attack under different scenarios.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3746 \nPMCID: PMC4834871\nPMID: 26828419  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The low predictive power of single SNPs, coupled with the high\nsignificance threshold needed to correct for multiple testing, greatly decreases \nthe power of GWAS.\nRESULTS: We propose a procedure in which all the SNPs are analyzed in a multiple \ngeneralized linear model, and we show its use for extremely high-dimensional\ndatasets. Our method yields P-values for assessing significance of single SNPs or\ngroups of SNPs while controlling for all other SNPs and the family wise error\nrate (FWER). Thus, our method tests whether or not a SNP carries any additional\ninformation about the phenotype beyond that available by all the other SNPs. This\nrules out spurious correlations between phenotypes and SNPs that can arise from\nmarginal methods because the 'spuriously correlated' SNP merely happens to be\ncorrelated with the 'truly causal' SNP. In addition, the method offers a data\ndriven approach to identifying and refining groups of SNPs that jointly contain\ninformative signals about the phenotype. We demonstrate the value of our method\nby applying it to the seven diseases analyzed by the Wellcome Trust Case Control \nConsortium (WTCCC). We show, in particular, that our method is also capable of\nfinding significant SNPs that were not identified in the original WTCCC study,\nbut were replicated in other independent studies.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Reproducibility of our research is supported by \nthe open-source Bioconductor package hierGWAS.\nCONTACT: peter.buehlmann@stat.math.ethz.ch\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Tailored statistical models and computational methods are\nrequired to resolve the subpopulation structure, i.e. to correctly identify and\ncharacterize subpopulations. These approaches also support the unraveling of\nsources of cell-to-cell variability. Finite mixture models have shown promise,\nbut the available approaches are ill suited to the simultaneous consideration of \ndata from multiple experimental conditions and to censored data. The prevalence\nand relevance of single-cell data and the lack of suitable computational\nanalytics make automated methods, that are able to deal with the requirements\nposed by these data, necessary.\nRESULTS: We present MEMO, a flexible mixture modeling framework that enables the \nsimultaneous, automated analysis of censored and uncensored data acquired under\nmultiple experimental conditions. MEMO is based on maximum-likelihood inference\nand allows for testing competing hypotheses. MEMO can be applied to a variety of \ndifferent single-cell data types. We demonstrate the advantages of MEMO by\nanalyzing right and interval censored single-cell microscopy data. Our results\nshow that an examination of censoring and the simultaneous consideration of\ndifferent experimental conditions are necessary to reveal biologically meaningful\nsubpopulation structures. MEMO allows for a stringent analysis of single-cell\ndata and enables researchers to avoid misinterpretation of censored data.\nTherefore, MEMO is a valuable asset for all fields that infer the characteristics\nof populations by looking at single individuals such as cell biology and\nmedicine.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MEMO is implemented in MATLAB and freely\navailable via github (https://github.com/MEMO-toolbox/MEMO).\nCONTACTS: eva-maria.geissen@ist.uni-stuttgart.de or\nnicole.radde@ist.uni-stuttgart.de\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Yet, given the\nlarge number of regulatory datasets, researchers are posed with a challenge of\nhow to efficiently utilize them to interpret the functional impact of SNP sets.\nRESULTS: We developed the GenomeRunner web server to automate systematic\nstatistical analysis of SNP sets within a regulatory context. Besides defining\nthe functional impact of SNP sets, GenomeRunner implements novel regulatory\nsimilarity/differential analyses, and cell type-specific regulatory enrichment\nanalysis. Validated against literature- and disease ontology-based approaches,\nanalysis of 39 disease/trait-associated SNP sets demonstrated that the functional\nimpact of SNP sets corresponds to known disease relationships. We identified a\ngroup of autoimmune diseases with SNPs distinctly enriched in the enhancers of T \nhelper cell subpopulations, and demonstrated relevant cell type-specificity of\nthe functional impact of other SNP sets. In summary, we show how systematic\nanalysis of genomic data within a regulatory context can help interpreting the\nfunctional impact of SNP sets.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GenomeRunner web server is freely available at\nhttp://www.integrativegenomics.org/\nCONTACT: mikhail.dozmorov@gmail.com\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Here we present a machine learning classifier to prioritize ADRs for\napproved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by combining chemical\nstructure (CS) and gene expression (GE) features. The GE data is from the Library\nof Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 dataset that\nmeasured changes in GE before and after treatment of human cells with over 20 000\nsmall-molecule compounds including most of the FDA-approved drugs. Using various \nbenchmarking methods, we show that the integration of GE data with the CS of the \ndrugs can significantly improve the predictability of ADRs. Moreover,\ntransforming GE features to enrichment vectors of biological terms further\nimproves the predictive capability of the classifiers. The most predictive\nbiological-term features can assist in understanding the drug mechanisms of\naction. Finally, we applied the classifier to all  >20 000 small-molecules\nprofiled, and developed a web portal for browsing and searching predictive\nsmall-molecule/ADR connections.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The interface for the adverse event predictions \nfor the  >20 000 LINCS compounds is available at http://maayanlab.net/SEP-L1000/ \nCONTACT: avi.maayan@mssm.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Analysis of a\ntraining set from Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) for several alleles indicates\nthat the sampling of the peptide space is extremely sparse covering a tiny\nfraction of the possible nonamer space, and also heavily skewed, thus restricting\nthe range of epitope prediction.\nRESULTS: We present a new epitope prediction method that has four distinct\ncomputational modules: (i) structural modelling, estimating statistical\npair-potentials and constraint derivation, (ii) implicit modelling and\ninteraction profiling, (iii) feature representation and binding affinity\nprediction and (iv) use of graphical models to extract peptide sequence\nsignatures to predict epitopes for HLA class I alleles.\nCONCLUSIONS: HLaffy is a novel and efficient epitope prediction method that\npredicts epitopes for any Class-1 HLA allele, by estimating the binding strengths\nof peptide-HLA complexes which is achieved through learning pair-potentials\nimportant for peptide binding. It relies on the strength of the mechanistic\nunderstanding of peptide-HLA recognition and provides an estimate of the total\nligand space for each allele. The performance of HLaffy is seen to be superior to\nthe currently available methods.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is made accessible through a\nwebserver http://proline.biochem.iisc.ernet.in/HLaffy\nCONTACT: : nchandra@biochem.iisc.ernet.in\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Here, we report a\nnew tool for displaying large and diverse genomic data along chromosomes. The\nsoftware is implemented in R so that visualization can be easily integrated with \nits numerous packages for processing genomic data. It supports simultaneous\nvisualization of multiple tracks of data. Large genomic regions such as QTLs or\nsynteny tracts may be shown along histograms of number of genes, genetic\nvariants, or any other type of genomic element. Tracks can also contain values\nfor continuous or categorical variables and the user can choose among points,\nconnected lines, colored segments, or histograms for representing data. chromPlot\ntakes data from tables in data.frame in GRanges formats. The information\nnecessary to draw chromosomes for mouse and human is included with the package.\nFor other organisms, chromPlot can read Gap and cytoBandIdeo tables from the UCSC\nGenome Browser.

The resulting data\nfrom Tn-seq experiments consist of sequence reads mapped to millions of potential\ntransposon insertion sites and a large portion of insertion sites have zero\nmapped reads. Novel statistical method for Tn-seq data analysis is needed to\ninfer functions of genes on bacterial growth.\nRESULTS: In this article, we propose a zero-inflated Poisson model for analyzing \nthe Tn-seq data that are high-dimensional and with an excess of zeros. Maximum\nlikelihood estimates of model parameters are obtained using an\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and pseudogenes are utilized to\nconstruct appropriate statistical tests for the transposon insertion tolerance of\nnormal genes of interest. We propose a multiple testing procedure that\ncategorizes genes into each of the three states, hypo-tolerant, tolerant and\nhyper-tolerant, while controlling the false discovery rate. We evaluate the\nproposed method with simulation studies and apply the proposed method to a real\nTn-seq data from an experiment that studied the bacterial pathogen, Campylobacter\njejuniAvailability and implementation: We provide R code for implementing our\nproposed method at http://github.com/ffliu/TnSeq A user's guide with example data\nanalysis is also available there.\nCONTACT: pliu@iastate.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Synthetic peptides for the desired target represent an\nimportant alternative to antibodies. However, no computational tool exists to\nguide the design of these peptides.\nRESULTS: To identify the interacting residues in a given antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag)\ninterface we used Interface Interacting Residue (I2R), a selection method based\non computed molecular interactions. The aggregation of all the molecular\ninteractions between epitope and paratope residues allowed us to transform the 3D\nAb-Ag complex structures into interface graphs. Based on these data and the\nprobability of molecular interaction we developed EPI-Peptide Designer tool that \nuses predicted paratope residues for an epitope of interest to generate targeted \npeptide ligand libraries. EPI-Peptide Designer successfully predicted 301\npeptides able to bind to LiD1 target protein (65% of the experimentally tested\npeptides), an enrichment of 22% compared to randomly generated peptides. This\ntool should enable the development of a new generation of synthetic interacting\npeptides that could be very useful in the biosensor, diagnostic and therapeutic\nfields.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All software developed in this work are\navailable at http://www.biocomp.icb.ufmg.br/biocomp/\nCONTACT: liza@icb.ufmg.br\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Both types of perturbations can affect gene\nexpression levels and disease outcome.

As different data types are usually dependent, analysis based on\nindependence assumptions will make inefficient use of the data and potentially\nlead to false conclusions.\nMODEL: Here, we present PINCAGE (Probabilistic INtegration of CAncer GEnomics\ndata), a method that uses probabilistic integration of cancer genomics data for\ncombined evaluation of RNA-seq gene expression and 450k array DNA methylation\nmeasurements of promoters as well as gene bodies. It models the dependence\nbetween expression and methylation using modular graphical models, which also\nallows future inclusion of additional data types.\nRESULTS: We apply our approach to a Breast Invasive Carcinoma dataset from The\nCancer Genome Atlas consortium, which includes 82 adjacent normal and 730 cancer \nsamples. We identify new biomarker candidates of breast cancer development\n(PTF1A, RABIF, RAG1AP1, TIMM17A, LOC148145) and progression (SERPINE3, ZNF706).\nPINCAGE discriminates better between normal and tumour tissue and between\nprogressing and non-progressing tumours in comparison with established methods\nthat assume independence between tested data types, especially when using\nevidence from multiple genes.

They can be bound\nwith proteins (activators) to activate transcription of a gene, and hence play a \ncritical role in promoting gene transcription in eukaryotes. With the avalanche\nof DNA sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is a challenging task to\ndevelop computational methods for timely identifying enhancers from extremely\ncomplicated DNA sequences. Although some efforts have been made in this regard,\nthey were limited at only identifying whether a query DNA element being of an\nenhancer or not. According to the distinct levels of biological activities and\nregulatory effects on target genes, however, enhancers should be further\nclassified into strong and weak ones in strength.\nRESULTS: In view of this, a two-layer predictor called ' IENHANCER-2L: ' was\nproposed by formulating DNA elements with the 'pseudo k-tuple nucleotide\ncomposition', into which the six DNA local parameters were incorporated. To the\nbest of our knowledge, it is the first computational predictor ever established\nfor identifying not only enhancers, but also their strength. Rigorous\ncross-validation tests have indicated that IENHANCER-2L: holds very high\npotential to become a useful tool for genome analysis.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: For the convenience of most experimental\nscientists, a web server for the two-layer predictor was established at\nhttp://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iEnhancer-2L/, by which users can easily get\ntheir desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.\nCONTACT: bliu@gordonlifescience.org, bliu@insun.hit.edu.cn, xlan@stanford.edu,\nkcchou@gordonlifescience.org\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

One key\nchallenge is to detect functional driver pathways and to filter out nonfunctional\npassenger genes in cancer genomics. Vandin et al. introduced the Maximum Weight\nSub-matrix Problem to find driver pathways and showed that it is an NP-hard\nproblem.\nMETHODS: To find a better solution and solve the problem more efficiently, we\npresent a network-based method (NBM) to detect overlapping driver pathways\nautomatically. This algorithm can directly find driver pathways or gene sets de\nnovo from somatic mutation data utilizing two combinatorial properties, high\ncoverage and high exclusivity, without any prior information. We firstly\nconstruct gene networks based on the approximate exclusivity between each pair of\ngenes using somatic mutation data from many cancer patients. Secondly, we present\na new greedy strategy to add or remove genes for obtaining overlapping gene sets \nwith driver mutations according to the properties of high exclusivity and high\ncoverage.\nRESULTS: To assess the efficiency of the proposed NBM, we apply the method on\nsimulated data and compare results obtained from the NBM, RME, Dendrix and\nMulti-Dendrix. NBM obtains optimal results in less than nine seconds on a\nconventional computer and the time complexity is much less than the three other\nmethods. To further verify the performance of NBM, we apply the method to analyze\nsomatic mutation data from five real biological data sets such as the mutation\nprofiles of 90 glioblastoma tumor samples and 163 lung carcinoma samples. NBM\ndetects groups of genes which overlap with known pathways, including P53, RB and \nRTK/RAS/PI(3)K signaling pathways. New gene sets with p-value less than 1e-3 are \nfound from the somatic mutation data.\nCONCLUSIONS: NBM can detect more biologically relevant gene sets. Results show\nthat NBM outperforms other algorithms for detecting driver pathways or gene sets.\nFurther research will be conducted with the use of novel machine learning\ntechniques.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S5-S3 \nPMCID: PMC4402595\nPMID: 25859819  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Since a scoring function (SF) is used to score, rank, and identify drug \nleads, the fidelity with which it predicts the affinity of a ligand candidate for\na protein's binding site has a significant bearing on the accuracy of virtual\nscreening. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are\neither force-field based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited predictive\npower has been a major roadblock toward cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore,\nin this work, we present novel SFs employing a large ensemble of neural networks \n(NN) in conjunction with a diverse set of physicochemical and geometrical\nfeatures characterizing protein-ligand complexes to predict binding affinity.\nRESULTS: We assess the scoring accuracies of two new ensemble NN SFs based on\nbagging (BgN-Score) and boosting (BsN-Score), as well as those of conventional\nSFs in the context of the 2007 PDBbind benchmark that encompasses a diverse set\nof high-quality protein families. We find that BgN-Score and BsN-Score have more \nthan 25% better Pearson's correlation coefficient (0.804 and 0.816 vs. 0.644)\nbetween predicted and measured binding affinities compared to that achieved by a \nstate-of-the-art conventional SF. In addition, these ensemble NN SFs are also at \nleast 19% more accurate (0.804 and 0.816 vs. 0.675) than SFs based on a single\nneural network that has been traditionally used in drug discovery applications.\nWe further find that ensemble models based on NNs surpass SFs based on the\ndecision-tree ensemble technique Random Forests.\nCONCLUSIONS: Ensemble neural networks SFs, BgN-Score and BsN-Score, are the most \naccurate in predicting binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes among the\nconsidered SFs. Moreover, their accuracies are even higher when they are used to \npredict binding affinities of protein-ligand complexes that are related to their \ntraining sets.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S4-S8 \nPMCID: PMC4347622\nPMID: 25734685  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The acquisition of a novel N-glycosylation site may have \nsignificant effect on protein structure and function, and therefore, on the\nphenotype.\nRESULTS: We analyzed the human glycoproteome data set (2,534 N-glycosylation\nsites in 1,027 proteins) and identified 112 novel N-glycosylation sites in 91\nproteins that arose in the human lineage since the last common ancestor of\nEuarchonta (primates and treeshrews). Three of them, Asn-196 in adipocyte plasma \nmembrane-associated protein (APMAP), Asn-91 in cluster of differentiation 166\n(CD166/ALCAM), and Asn-76 in thyroglobulin, are human-specific. Molecular\nevolutionary analysis suggested that these sites were under positive selection\nduring human evolution. Notably, the Asn-76 of thyroglobulin might be involved in\nthe increased production of thyroid hormones in humans, especially thyroxine\n(T4), because the removal of the glycan moiety from this site was reported to\nresult in a significant decrease in T4 production.\nCONCLUSIONS: We propose that the novel N-glycosylation sites described in this\nstudy may be useful candidates for functional analyses to identify innovative\ngenetic modifications for beneficial phenotypes acquired in the human lineage.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0468-5 \nPMCID: PMC4314935\nPMID: 25628020  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We propose a versatile platform to automatically extract features for\nrisk prediction, based on a pre-defined and extensible entity schema. The\nextraction is independent of disease type or risk prediction task. We contrast\nauto-extracted features to baselines generated from the Elixhauser comorbidities.\nRESULTS: Hospital medical records was transformed to event sequences, to which\nfilters were applied to extract feature sets capturing diversity in temporal\nscales and data types. The features were evaluated on a readmission prediction\ntask, comparing with baseline feature sets generated from the Elixhauser\ncomorbidities. The prediction model was through logistic regression with elastic \nnet regularization. Predictions horizons of 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 months were considered\nfor four diverse diseases: diabetes, COPD, mental disorders and pneumonia, with\nderivation and validation cohorts defined on non-overlapping data-collection\nperiods. For unplanned readmissions, auto-extracted feature set using\nsocio-demographic information and medical records, outperformed baselines derived\nfrom the socio-demographic information and Elixhauser comorbidities, over 20\nsettings (5 prediction horizons over 4 diseases). In particular over 30-day\nprediction, the AUCs are: COPD-baseline: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.63),\nauto-extracted: 0.67 (0.64, 0.70); diabetes-baseline: 0.60 (0.58, 0.63),\nauto-extracted: 0.67 (0.64, 0.69); mental disorders-baseline: 0.57 (0.54, 0.60), \nauto-extracted: 0.69 (0.64,0.70); pneumonia-baseline: 0.61 (0.59, 0.63),\nauto-extracted: 0.70 (0.67, 0.72).\nCONCLUSIONS: The advantages of auto-extracted standard features from complex\nmedical records, in a disease and task agnostic manner were demonstrated.\nAuto-extracted features have good predictive power over multiple time horizons.\nSuch feature sets have potential to form the foundation of complex automated\nanalytic tasks.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0425-8 \nPMCID: PMC4310185\nPMID: 25547173  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Epub\n2014 Dec 8.\n\nUse B-factor related features for accurate classification between protein binding\ninterfaces and crystal packing contacts.\n\nLiu Q, Li Z, Li J.\n\nBACKGROUND: Distinction between true protein interactions and crystal packing\ncontacts is important for structural bioinformatics studies to respond to the\nneed of accurate classification of the rapidly increasing protein structures.\nThere are many unannotated crystal contacts and there also exist false\nannotations in this rapidly expanding volume of data. Previous tools have been\nproposed to address this problem. However, challenging issues still remain, such \nas low performance when the training and test data contain mixed interfaces\nhaving diverse sizes of contact areas.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: B factor is a measure to quantify the vibrational motion of \nan atom, a more relevant feature than interface size to characterize protein\nbinding. We propose to use three features related to B factor for the\nclassification between biological interfaces and crystal packing contacts. The\nfirst feature is the sum of the normalized B factors of the interfacial atoms in \nthe contact area, the second is the average of the interfacial B factor per\nresidue in the chain, and the third is the average number of interfacial atoms\nwith a negative normalized B factor per residue in the chain. We investigate the \ndistribution properties of these basic features and a compound feature on four\ndatasets of biological binding and crystal packing, and on a protein binding-only\ndataset with known binding affinity. We also compare the cross-dataset\nclassification performance of these features with existing methods and with a\nwidely-used and the most effective feature interface area. The results\ndemonstrate that our features outperform the interface area approach and the\nexisting prediction methods remarkably for many tests on all of these datasets.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed B factor related features are more effective than\ninterface area to distinguish crystal packing from biological binding interfaces.\nOur computational methods have a potential for large-scale and accurate\nidentification of biological interactions from the experimentally determined\nstructural data stored at PDB which may have diverse interface sizes.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S3 \nPMCID: PMC4290652\nPMID: 25522196  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we introduce a method for\nsuper-resolution imaging of the multiscale organization of intact tissues. The\nmethod, called magnified analysis of the proteome (MAP), linearly expands entire \norgans fourfold while preserving their overall architecture and three-dimensional\nproteome organization. MAP is based on the observation that preventing\ncrosslinking within and between endogenous proteins during hydrogel-tissue\nhybridization allows for natural expansion upon protein denaturation and\ndissociation. The expanded tissue preserves its protein content, its fine\nsubcellular details, and its organ-scale intercellular connectivity. We use\noff-the-shelf antibodies for multiple rounds of immunolabeling and imaging of a\ntissue's magnified proteome, and our experiments demonstrate a success rate of\n82% (100/122 antibodies tested). We show that specimen size can be reversibly\nmodulated to image both inter-regional connections and fine synaptic\narchitectures in the mouse brain.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3641 \nPMID: 27454740  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Separately, orange-red FPs are useful for deep-tissue imaging in\nmammals owing to the relative tissue transmissibility of orange-red light, but\ntheir dependence on illumination limits their sensitivity as reporters in deep\ntissues. Here we describe CyOFP1, a bright, engineered, orange-red FP that is\nexcitable by cyan light. We show that CyOFP1 enables single-excitation\nmultiplexed imaging with GFP-based probes in single-photon and two-photon\nmicroscopy, including time-lapse imaging in light-sheet systems. CyOFP1 also\nserves as an efficient acceptor for resonance energy transfer from the highly\ncatalytic blue-emitting luciferase NanoLuc. An optimized fusion of CyOFP1 and\nNanoLuc, called Antares, functions as a highly sensitive bioluminescent reporter \nin vivo, producing substantially brighter signals from deep tissues than firefly \nluciferase and other bioluminescent proteins.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3550 \nPMCID: PMC4942401 [Available on 2016-11-30]\nPMID: 27240196  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Here we determine the identity of unassigned peptides using an\nultra-tolerant Sequest database search that allows peptide matching even with\nmodifications of unknown masses up to ± 500 Da. In a proteome-wide data set on\nHEK293 cells (9,513 proteins and 396,736 peptides), this approach matched an\nadditional 184,000 modified peptides, which were linked to biological and\nchemical modifications representing 523 distinct mass bins, including\nphosphorylation, glycosylation and methylation. We localized all unknown\nmodification masses to specific regions within a peptide. Known modifications\nwere assigned to the correct amino acids with frequencies >90%. We conclude that \nat least one-third of unassigned spectra arise from peptides with\nsubstoichiometric modifications.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3267 \nPMCID: PMC4515955\nPMID: 26076430  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We introduce the MinHash Alignment Process (MHAP) for overlapping\nnoisy, long reads using probabilistic, locality-sensitive hashing. Integrating\nMHAP with the Celera Assembler enabled reference-grade de novo assemblies of\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster and a\nhuman hydatidiform mole cell line (CHM1) from SMRT sequencing. The resulting\nassemblies are highly continuous, include fully resolved chromosome arms and\nclose persistent gaps in these reference genomes. Our assembly of D. melanogaster\nrevealed previously unknown heterochromatic and telomeric transition sequences,\nand we assembled low-complexity sequences from CHM1 that fill gaps in the human\nGRCh38 reference. Using MHAP and the Celera Assembler, single-molecule sequencing\ncan produce de novo near-complete eukaryotic assemblies that are 99.99% accurate \nwhen compared with available reference genomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3238 \nPMID: 26006009  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we describe an approach for global detection of DNA double-stranded\nbreaks (DSBs) introduced by RGNs and potentially other nucleases. This method,\ncalled genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing\n(GUIDE-seq), relies on capture of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides into\nDSBs. Application of GUIDE-seq to 13 RGNs in two human cell lines revealed wide\nvariability in RGN off-target activities and unappreciated characteristics of\noff-target sequences. The majority of identified sites were not detected by\nexisting computational methods or chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing\n(ChIP-seq). GUIDE-seq also identified RGN-independent genomic breakpoint\n'hotspots'. Finally, GUIDE-seq revealed that truncated guide RNAs exhibit\nsubstantially reduced RGN-induced, off-target DSBs. Our experiments define the\nmost rigorous framework for genome-wide identification of RGN off-target effects \nto date and provide a method for evaluating the safety of these nucleases before \nclinical use.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3117 \nPMCID: PMC4320685\nPMID: 25513782  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

It is considered the 'gold standard' for\nmodeling human influenza virus infection and transmission. Here we describe the\n2.41 Gb draft genome assembly of the domestic ferret, constituting 2.28 Gb of\nsequence plus gaps. We annotated 19,910 protein-coding genes on this assembly\nusing RNA-seq data from 21 ferret tissues. We characterized the ferret host\nresponse to two influenza virus infections by RNA-seq analysis of 42 ferret\nsamples from influenza time-course data and showed distinct signatures in ferret \ntrachea and lung tissues specific to 1918 or 2009 human pandemic influenza virus \ninfections. Using microarray data from 16 ferret samples reflecting cystic\nfibrosis disease progression, we showed that transcriptional changes in the\nCFTR-knockout ferret lung reflect pathways of early disease that cannot be\nreadily studied in human infants with cystic fibrosis disease.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3079 \nPMCID: PMC4262547\nPMID: 25402615  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

While many automated\nmethods for segmentation perform very well, few generalize reliably to diverse\ndatasets. Such automated methods could significantly benefit from at least\nminimal user guidance. Identification and correction of segmentation errors in\ntime-series data is of prime importance for proper validation of the subsequent\nanalysis. The primary contribution of this work is a novel method for interactive\nsegmentation and analysis of microscopy data, which learns from and guides user\ninteractions to improve overall segmentation.\nRESULTS: We introduce an interactive cell analysis application, called CellECT,\nfor 3D+t microscopy datasets. The core segmentation tool is watershed-based and\nallows the user to add, remove or modify existing segments by means of\nmanipulating guidance markers. A confidence metric learns from the user\ninteraction and highlights regions of uncertainty in the segmentation for the\nuser's attention. User corrected segmentations are then propagated to neighboring\ntime points. The analysis tool computes local and global statistics for various\ncell measurements over the time sequence. Detailed results on two large datasets \ncontaining membrane and nuclei data are presented: a 3D+t confocal microscopy\ndataset of the ascidian Phallusia mammillata consisting of 18 time points, and a \n3D+t single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) dataset consisting of 192 time\npoints. Additionally, CellECT was used to segment a large population of\njigsaw-puzzle shaped epidermal cells from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. The cell\ncoordinates obtained using CellECT are compared to those of manually segmented\ncells.\nCONCLUSIONS: CellECT provides tools for convenient segmentation and analysis of\n3D+t membrane datasets by incorporating human interaction into automated\nalgorithms. Users can modify segmentation results through the help of guidance\nmarkers, and an adaptive confidence metric highlights problematic regions.\nSegmentations can be propagated to multiple time points, and once a segmentation \nis available for a time sequence cells can be analyzed to observe trends. The\nsegmentation and analysis tools presented here generalize well to membrane or\ncell wall volumetric time series datasets.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0927-7 \nPMCID: PMC4756481\nPMID: 26887436  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Despite\ntechnical advances in the latest years, these methods are not able to cope with\nlarge drug-target interaction spaces and to integrate multiple sources of\nbiological information.\nRESULTS: We propose KronRLS-MKL, which models the drug-target interaction problem\nas a link prediction task on bipartite networks. This method allows the\nintegration of multiple heterogeneous information sources for the identification \nof new interactions, and can also work with networks of arbitrary size. Moreover,\nit automatically selects the more relevant kernels by returning weights\nindicating their importance in the drug-target prediction at hand. Empirical\nanalysis on four data sets using twenty distinct kernels indicates that our\nmethod has higher or comparable predictive performance than 18 competing methods \nin all prediction tasks. Moreover, the predicted weights reflect the predictive\nquality of each kernel on exhaustive pairwise experiments, which indicates the\nsuccess of the method to automatically reveal relevant biological sources.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our analysis show that the proposed data integration strategy is\nable to improve the quality of the predicted interactions, and can speed up the\nidentification of new drug-target interactions as well as identify relevant\ninformation for the task.\nAVAILABILITY: The source code and data sets are available at\nwww.cin.ufpe.br/~acan/kronrlsmkl/.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0890-3 \nPMCID: PMC4722636\nPMID: 26801218  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Many existing gene pair evaluation methods\ncannot highlight diverse patterns of gene pairs only used one strategy of\nvertical comparison and horizontal comparison, while individual-gene-ranking\nmethod ignores redundancy and synergy among genes.\nRESULTS: Here we proposed a novel score measure named relative simplicity (RS).\nWe evaluated gene pairs according to integrating vertical comparison with\nhorizontal comparison, finally built RS-based direct classifier (RS-based DC)\nbased on a set of informative genes capable of binary discrimination with a\npaired votes strategy. Nine multi-class gene expression datasets involving human \ncancers were used to validate the performance of new method. Compared with the\nnine reference models, RS-based DC received the highest average independent test \naccuracy (91.40%), the best generalization performance and the smallest\ninformative average gene number (20.56). Compared with the four reference feature\nselection methods, RS also received the highest average test accuracy in three\nclassifiers (Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine), and\nonly RS can improve the performance of SVM.\nCONCLUSIONS: Diverse patterns of gene pairs could be highlighted more fully while\nintegrating vertical comparison with horizontal comparison strategy. DC core\nclassifier can effectively control over-fitting. RS-based feature selection\nmethod combined with DC classifier can lead to more robust selection of\ninformative genes and classification accuracy.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0893-0 \nPMCID: PMC4721022\nPMID: 26792270  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The \npackage is available from the Bioconductor repository and implements additional\nsupport for standardized expression data preprocessing, differential expression\nanalysis, and definition of suitable input gene sets and networks.\nCONCLUSION: The EnrichmentBrowser package implements essential functionality for \nthe enrichment analysis of gene expression data. It combines the advantages of\nset-based and network-based enrichment analysis in order to derive\nhigh-confidence gene sets and biological pathways that are differentially\nregulated in the expression data under investigation. Besides, the package\nfacilitates the visualization and exploration of such sets and pathways.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0884-1 \nPMCID: PMC4721010\nPMID: 26791995  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Among the\nexisting methods, since composition-based algorithms are not sufficient for\nclassifying short reads, recent algorithms use only the feature of similarity, or\nsimilarity-based combined features. However, those algorithms suffer from the\ncomputational expense because the task of similarity search is very\ntime-consuming. Besides, the lack of similarity information between reads and\nreference sequences due to the length of short reads reduces significantly the\nclassification quality.\nRESULTS: This paper presents a novel taxonomic assignment algorithm, called\nSeMeta, which is based on semi-supervised learning to produce a fast and highly\naccurate classification of short-length reads with sufficient mutual overlap. The\nproposed algorithm firstly separates reads into clusters using their composition \nfeature. It then labels the clusters with the support of an efficient filtering\ntechnique on results of the similarity search between their reads and reference\ndatabases. Furthermore, instead of performing the similarity search for all reads\nin the clusters, SeMeta only does for reads in their subgroups by utilizing the\ninformation of sequence overlapping. The experimental results demonstrate that\nSeMeta outperforms two other similarity-based algorithms on different aspects.\nCONCLUSIONS: By using a semi-supervised method as well as taking the advantages\nof various features, the proposed algorithm is able not only to achieve high\nclassification quality, but also to reduce much computational cost.

Due to the limitation of the NGS technologies, there could be errors \nin the reads. The error rate of the reads can be reduced with trimming and by\ncorrecting the erroneous bases of the reads. It helps to achieve high quality\ndata and the computational complexity of many biological applications will be\ngreatly reduced if the reads are first corrected. We have developed a novel error\ncorrection algorithm called EC and compared it with four other state-of-the-art\nalgorithms using both real and simulated sequencing reads.\nRESULTS: We have done extensive and rigorous experiments that reveal that EC is\nindeed an effective, scalable, and efficient error correction tool. Real reads\nthat we have employed in our performance evaluation are Illumina-generated short \nreads of various lengths. Six experimental datasets we have utilized are taken\nfrom sequence and read archive (SRA) at NCBI. The simulated reads are obtained by\npicking substrings from random positions of reference genomes. To introduce\nerrors, some of the bases of the simulated reads are changed to other bases with \nsome probabilities.\nCONCLUSIONS: Error correction is a vital problem in biology especially for NGS\ndata. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, called Error Corrector (EC),\nfor correcting substitution errors in biological sequencing reads. We plan to\ninvestigate the possibility of employing the techniques introduced in this\nresearch paper to handle insertion and deletion errors also.\nSOFTWARE AVAILABILITY: The implementation is freely available for non-commercial \npurposes.

Existing\nmethods of species richness estimation ride on the assumption that the reads in\neach assembled contig correspond to only one of the microbial genomes in the\npopulation. This assumption and the underlying probabilistic formulations of\nexisting methods are not useful for quasispecies populations where the strains\nare highly genetically related.\nRESULTS: On benchmark data sets, our estimation method provided accurate richness\nestimates (< 0.2 median estimation error) and improved the precision of ViQuaS by\n2%-13% and F-score by 1%-9% without compromising the recall rates. We also\ndemonstrate that our estimation method can be used to improve the precision and\nF-score of ShoRAH by 0%-7% and 0%-5% respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed probabilistic estimation method can be used to estimate\nthe richness of viral populations with a quasispecies behavior and to improve the\naccuracy of the quasispecies spectra reconstructed by the existing methods ViQuaS\nand ShoRAH in the presence of a moderate level of technical sequencing errors.\nAVAILABILITY: http://sourceforge.net/projects/viquas/.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S18-S3 \nPMCID: PMC4682401\nPMID: 26678073  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, while there have been great\nadvances in algorithms and software to reconstruct the history of gene families, \nthese tools do not model the domain shuffling events (domain duplication,\ninsertion, transfer, and deletion) that drive the evolution of multidomain\nprotein families. Protein evolution through domain shuffling events allows for\nrapid exploration of functions by introducing new combinations of existing folds.\nThis powerful mechanism was key to some significant evolutionary innovations,\nsuch as multicellularity and the vertebrate immune system. A method for\nreconstructing this important evolutionary process is urgently needed.\nRESULTS: Here, we introduce a novel, event-based framework for studying\nmultidomain evolution by reconciling a domain tree with a gene tree, with\nadditional information provided by the species tree. In the context of this\nframework, we present the first reconciliation algorithms to infer domain\nshuffling events, while addressing the challenges inherent in the inference of\nevolution across three levels of organization.\nCONCLUSIONS: We apply these methods to the evolution of domains in the Membrane\nassociated Guanylate Kinase family.

To date, how to generate a high-quality draft\nassembly for metagenomic sequencing projects has not been fully addressed.\nRESULTS: We conducted a comprehensive assessment on state-of-the-art de novo\nassemblers and revealed that the performance of each assembler depends critically\non the sequencing depth. To address this problem, we developed a pipeline named\nInteMAP to integrate three assemblers, ABySS, IDBA-UD and CABOG, which were found\nto complement each other in assembling metagenomic sequences. Making a decision\nof which assembling approaches to use according to the sequencing coverage\nestimation algorithm for each short read, the pipeline presents an automatic\nplatform suitable to assemble real metagenomic NGS data with uneven coverage\ndistribution of sequencing depth. By comparing the performance of InteMAP with\ncurrent assemblers on both synthetic and real NGS metagenomic data, we\ndemonstrated that InteMAP achieves better performance with a longer total contig \nlength and higher contiguity, and contains more genes than others.\nCONCLUSIONS: We developed a de novo pipeline, named InteMAP, that integrates\nexisting tools for metagenomics assembly. The pipeline outperforms previous\nassembly methods on metagenomic assembly by providing a longer total contig\nlength, a higher contiguity and covering more genes. InteMAP, therefore, could\npotentially be a useful tool for the research community of metagenomics.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0686-x \nPMCID: PMC4545859\nPMID: 26250558  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Their effective interstitial and macro-environmental \nuse requires energetic and structural stability. One successful group of these\npeptides includes a tri-disulfide domain arrangement that offers toxicity and\nhigh stability. Sequential tri-disulfide connectivity variants create highly\ncompact disulfide folds capable of withstanding a variety of environmental\nstresses. Their combination of toxicity and stability make these peptides\nremarkably valuable for their potential as bio-insecticides, antimicrobial\npeptides and peptide drug candidates. However, the wide sequence variation,\nsources and modalities of group members impose serious limitations on our ability\nto rapidly identify potential members. As a result, there is a need for automated\nhigh-throughput member classification approaches that leverage their demonstrated\ntertiary and functional homology.\nRESULTS: We developed an SVM-based model to predict sequential tri-disulfide\npeptide (STP) toxins from peptide sequences. One optimized model, called PredSTP,\npredicted STPs from training set with sensitivity, specificity, precision,\naccuracy and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 94.86%, 94.11%, 84.31%, 94.30%\nand 0.86, respectively, using 200 fold cross validation. The same model\noutperforms existing prediction approaches in three independent out of sample\ntestsets derived from PDB.\nCONCLUSION: PredSTP can accurately identify a wide range of cystine stabilized\npeptide toxins directly from sequences in a species-agnostic fashion. The ability\nto rapidly filter sequences for potential bioactive peptides can greatly compress\nthe time between peptide identification and testing structural and functional\nproperties for possible antimicrobial and insecticidal candidates.

Furthermore, multiple sample classes often complicate FE because\nevaluating performance, which is usual in supervised FE, is generally harder than\nthe two-class problem. Developing sample classification independent unsupervised \nmethods would solve many of these problems.\nRESULTS: Two principal component analysis (PCA)-based FE, specifically,\nvariational Bayes PCA (VBPCA) was extended to perform unsupervised FE, and\ntogether with conventional PCA (CPCA)-based unsupervised FE, were tested as\nsample classification independent unsupervised FE methods. VBPCA- and CPCA-based \nunsupervised FE both performed well when applied to simulated data, and a\nposttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-mediated heart disease data set that had\nmultiple categorical class observations in mRNA/microRNA expression of stressed\nmouse heart. A critical set of PTSD miRNAs/mRNAs were identified that show\naberrant expression between treatment and control samples, and significant,\nnegative correlation with one another. Moreover, greater stability and biological\nfeasibility than conventional supervised FE was also demonstrated. Based on the\nresults obtained, in silico drug discovery was performed as translational\nvalidation of the methods.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our two proposed unsupervised FE methods (CPCA- and VBPCA-based)\nworked well on simulated data, and outperformed two conventional supervised FE\nmethods on a real data set. Thus, these two methods have suggested equivalence\nfor FE on categorical multiclass data sets, with potential translational utility \nfor in silico drug discovery.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0574-4 \nPMCID: PMC4448281\nPMID: 25925353  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Despite\nongoing work moving toward shared data formats and linked identifiers,\nsignificant problems persist in semantic data integration in order to establish\nshared identity and shared meaning across heterogeneous biomedical data sources.\nRESULTS: We present five processes for semantic data integration that, when\napplied collectively, solve seven key problems. These processes include making\nexplicit the differences between biomedical concepts and database records,\naggregating sets of identifiers denoting the same biomedical concepts across data\nsources, and using declaratively represented forward-chaining rules to take\ninformation that is variably represented in source databases and integrating it\ninto a consistent biomedical representation. We demonstrate these processes and\nsolutions by presenting KaBOB (the Knowledge Base Of Biomedicine), a knowledge\nbase of semantically integrated data from 18 prominent biomedical databases using\ncommon representations grounded in Open Biomedical Ontologies. An instance of\nKaBOB with data about humans and seven major model organisms can be built using\non the order of 500 million RDF triples. All source code for building KaBOB is\navailable under an open-source license.\nCONCLUSIONS: KaBOB is an integrated knowledge base of biomedical data\nrepresentationally based in prominent, actively maintained Open Biomedical\nOntologies, thus enabling queries of the underlying data in terms of biomedical\nconcepts (e.g., genes and gene products, interactions and processes) rather than \nfeatures of source-specific data schemas or file formats. KaBOB resolves many of \nthe issues that routinely plague biomedical researchers intending to work with\ndata from multiple data sources and provides a platform for ongoing data\nintegration and development and for formal reasoning over a wealth of integrated \nbiomedical data.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0559-3 \nPMCID: PMC4448321\nPMID: 25903923  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

To counter\nthese new challenges, it is essential to study the interactions between M.\ntuberculosis and the host to learn how these bacteria cause disease.\nRESULTS: We report a systematic flow to predict the host pathogen interactions\n(HPIs) between M. tuberculosis and Homo sapiens based on sequence motifs. First, \nprotein sequences were used as initial input for identifying the HPIs by\n'interolog' method. HPIs were further filtered by prediction of domain-domain\ninteractions (DDIs). Functional annotations of protein and publicly available\nexperimental results were applied to filter the remaining HPIs. Using such a\nstrategy, 118 pairs of HPIs were identified, which involve 43 proteins from M.\ntuberculosis and 48 proteins from Homo sapiens. A biological interaction network \nbetween M. tuberculosis and Homo sapiens was then constructed using the predicted\ninter- and intra-species interactions based on the 118 pairs of HPIs. Finally, a \nweb accessible database named PATH (Protein interactions of M. tuberculosis and\nHuman) was constructed to store these predicted interactions and proteins.\nCONCLUSIONS: This interaction network will facilitate the research on\nhost-pathogen protein-protein interactions, and may throw light on how M.\ntuberculosis interacts with its host.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0535-y \nPMCID: PMC4456996\nPMID: 25887594  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

A major limitation of the overlapping transcription\nassays is the lack of high throughput expression data.\nRESULTS: We developed a new tool (IAOseq) that is based on reads distributions\nalong the transcribed regions to identify the expression levels of overlapping\ngenes from standard RNA-seq data. Compared with five commonly used quantification\nmethods, IAOseq showed better performance in the estimation accuracy of\noverlapping transcription levels. For the same strand overlapping transcription, \ncurrently existing high-throughput methods are rarely available to distinguish\nwhich strand was present in the original mRNA template. The IAOseq results showed\nthat the commonly used methods gave an average of 1.6 fold overestimation of the \nexpression levels of same strand overlapping genes.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work provides a useful tool for mining overlapping\ntranscription levels from standard RNA-seq libraries.

The free energy of RNA structure in another important key to its\nfunction as only some structures with a specific level of free energy can take\npart in cellular reactions. Therefore, to perform a specific function, a\nparticular RNA structure with specific level of free energy is required. For a\ngiven RNA structure, the goal of the RNA design problem is to design an RNA\nsequence that folds into the given structure. To mimic the biological features of\nRNA sequences and structures, some sequence and energy constraints should be\nconsidered in designing RNA. Although the level of free energy is important, it\nis not considered in the available approaches for RNA design problem.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we present a new version of our evolutionary algorithm\nfor RNA design problem, entitled ERD, and extend it to handle some sequence and\nenergy constraints. In the sequence constraints, one can restrict sequence\npositions to a fixed nucleotide or to a subset of nucleotides. As for the energy \nconstraint, one can specify an interval for the free energy ranges of the\ndesigned sequences. We compare our algorithm with INFO-RNA, MODENA, NUPACK, and\nRNAiFold approaches for some artificial and natural RNA secondary structures and \nconstraints.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the other\nmentioned approaches in terms of accuracy, speedup, divergency, nucleotides\ndistribution, and similarity to the natural RNA sequences. Particularly, the\ndesigned RNA sequences in our method are much more reliable and similar to the\nnatural counterparts. The generated sequences are more diverse and they have\ncloser nucleotides distribution to the natural one.

Several algorithms exist to detect CNVs by analyzing whole\ngenome sequencing data or data from samples enriched by hybridization-capture.\nPCR-enriched amplicon-sequencing data have special characteristics that have been\ntaken into account by only one publicly available algorithm so far.\nRESULTS: We describe a new algorithm named quandico to detect copy number\ndifferences based on NGS data generated following PCR-enrichment.

It is a minimal absent word if all its proper factors occur in y. Minimal\nabsent words have been computed in genomes of organisms from all domains of life;\ntheir computation also provides a fast alternative for measuring approximation in\nsequence comparison. There exists an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see\ntext]-space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words on a fixed-sized\nalphabet based on the construction of suffix automata (Crochemore et al., 1998). \nNo implementation of this algorithm is publicly available. There also exists an\n[Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see text]-space algorithm for the same\nproblem based on the construction of suffix arrays (Pinho et al., 2009). An\nimplementation of this algorithm was also provided by the authors and is\ncurrently the fastest available.\nRESULTS: Our contribution in this article is twofold: first, we bridge this\nunpleasant gap by presenting an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see\ntext]-space algorithm for computing all minimal absent words based on the\nconstruction of suffix arrays; and second, we provide the respective\nimplementation of this algorithm. Experimental results, using real and synthetic \ndata, show that this implementation outperforms the one by Pinho et al. The\nopen-source code of our implementation is freely available at\nhttp://github.com/solonas13/maw .\nCONCLUSIONS: Classical notions for sequence comparison are increasingly being\nreplaced by other similarity measures that refer to the composition of sequences \nin terms of their constituent patterns. One such measure is the minimal absent\nwords. In this article, we present a new linear-time and linear-space algorithm\nfor the computation of minimal absent words based on the suffix array.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0388-9 \nPMCID: PMC4297395\nPMID: 25526884  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We show that\nmeasurement of the average orientation of fluorescent dyes attached to rigid\nsample structures mapped to regularly defined (50 nm)(2) image nanoareas can\nprovide subdiffraction resolution (super resolution by polarization demodulation,\nSPoD). Because the polarization angle range for effective excitation of an\noriented molecule is rather broad and unspecific, we narrowed this range by\nsimultaneous irradiation with a second, de-excitation, beam possessing a\npolarization perpendicular to the excitation beam (excitation polarization angle \nnarrowing, ExPAN). This shortened the periodic emission flashes, allowing better \ndiscrimination between molecules or nanoareas. Our method requires neither the\ngeneration of nanometric interference structures nor the use of switchable or\nblinking fluorescent probes. We applied the method to standard wide-field\nmicroscopy with camera detection and to two-photon scanning microscopy, imaging\nthe fine structural details of neuronal spines.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2919 \nPMID: 24705472  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

(2)Department of Computer \nScience and Engineering and Innovation Center for Big Data and Digital\nConvergence, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.\n\nS-sulfenylation (S-sulphenylation, or sulfenic acid), the covalent attachment of \nS-hydroxyl (-SOH) to cysteine thiol, plays a significant role in redox regulation\nof protein functions. Although sulfenic acid is transient and labile, most of its\nphysiological activities occur under control of S-hydroxylation. Therefore,\ndiscriminating the substrate site of S-sulfenylated proteins is an essential task\nin computational biology for the furtherance of protein structures and functions.\nResearch into S-sulfenylated protein is currently very limited, and no dedicated \ntools are available for the computational identification of SOH sites. Given a\ntotal of 1096 experimentally verified S-sulfenylated proteins from humans, this\nstudy carries out a bioinformatics investigation on SOH sites based on amino acid\ncomposition and solvent-accessible surface area. A TwoSampleLogo indicates that\nthe positively and negatively charged amino acids flanking the SOH sites may\nimpact the formulation of S-sulfenylation in closed three-dimensional\nenvironments. In addition, the substrate motifs of SOH sites are studied using\nthe maximal dependence decomposition (MDD). Based on the concept of binary\nclassification between SOH and non-SOH sites, Support vector machine (SVM) is\napplied to learn the predictive model from MDD-identified substrate motifs.\nAccording to the evaluation results of 5-fold cross-validation, the integrated\nSVM model learned from substrate motifs yields an average accuracy of 0.87,\nsignificantly improving the prediction of SOH sites. Furthermore, the integrated \nSVM model also effectively improves the predictive performance in an independent \ntesting set. Finally, the integrated SVM model is applied to implement an\neffective web resource, named MDD-SOH, to identify SOH sites with their\ncorresponding substrate motifs.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The MDD-SOH is\nnow freely available to all interested users at\nhttp://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/MDDSOH/.

On occasion, the activation of one pathway can produce an effect\ndownstream of another pathway, a phenomenon known as crosstalk. Existing\ncomputational methods to discover such pathway pairs rely on simple overlap\nstatistics.\nRESULTS: We present Xtalk, a path-based approach for identifying pairs of\npathways that may crosstalk. Xtalk computes the statistical significance of the\naverage length of multiple short paths that connect receptors in one pathway to\nthe transcription factors in another. By design, Xtalk reports the precise\ninteractions and mechanisms that support the identified crosstalk. We applied\nXtalk to signaling pathways in the KEGG and NCI-PID databases. We manually\ncurated a gold standard set of 132 crosstalking pathway pairs and a set of 140\npairs that did not crosstalk, for which Xtalk achieved an area under the receiver\noperator characteristic curve of 0.65, a 12% improvement over the closest\ncompeting approach. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve\nvaried with the pathway, suggesting that crosstalk should be evaluated on a\npathway-by-pathway level. We also analyzed an extended set of 658 pathway pairs\nin KEGG and to a set of more than 7000 pathway pairs in NCI-PID. For the\ntop-ranking pairs, we found substantial support in the literature (81% for KEGG\nand 78% for NCI-PID). We provide examples of networks computed by Xtalk that\naccurately recovered known mechanisms of crosstalk.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The XTALK software is available at\nhttp://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~murali/software.

A key step to reconstructing\nsignaling networks involves identification of the set of all kinases and their\nsubstrates. Experimental characterization of kinase substrates is both expensive \nand time-consuming. To expedite the discovery of novel substrates, computational \napproaches based on kinase recognition sequence (motifs) from known substrates,\nprotein structure, interaction and co-localization have been proposed. However,\nrarely do these methods take into account the dynamic responses of signaling\ncascades measured from in vivo cellular systems. Given that recent advances in\nmass spectrometry-based technologies make it possible to quantify phosphorylation\non a proteome-wide scale, computational approaches that can integrate static\nfeatures with dynamic phosphoproteome data would greatly facilitate the\nprediction of biologically relevant kinase-specific substrates.\nRESULTS: Here, we propose a positive-unlabeled ensemble learning approach that\nintegrates dynamic phosphoproteomics data with static kinase recognition motifs\nto predict novel substrates for kinases of interest. We extended a\npositive-unlabeled learning technique for an ensemble model, which significantly \nimproves prediction sensitivity on novel substrates of kinases while retaining\nhigh specificity. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model using\nsimulation studies and subsequently applied it to predict novel substrates of key\nkinases relevant to insulin signaling. Our analyses show that static sequence\nmotifs and dynamic phosphoproteomics data are complementary and that the proposed\nintegrated model performs better than methods relying only on static information \nfor accurate prediction of kinase-specific substrates.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Executable GUI tool, source code and\ndocumentation are freely available at https://github.com/PengyiYang/KSP-PUEL.\nCONTACT: pengyi.yang@nih.gov or jothi@mail.nih.gov\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\nPublished by Oxford University Press 2015.

Simulation of reads is \naccompanied by information about their positions in the source genome. This\ninformation is then used to evaluate alignments produced by the mapper. Finally, \nreports containing statistics of successful read alignments are created.In\ndefault of standards for encoding read origins, every evaluation tool has to be\nmade explicitly compatible with the simulator used to generate reads.\nRESULTS: To solve this obstacle, we have created a generic format Read Naming\nFormat (Rnf) for assigning read names with encoded information about original\npositions. Futhermore, we have developed an associated software package RnfTools \ncontaining two principal components. MIShmash applies one of popular read\nsimulating tools (among DwgSim, Art, Mason, CuReSim, etc.) and transforms the\ngenerated reads into Rnf format. LAVEnder evaluates then a given read mapper\nusing simulated reads in Rnf format.

The accuracy of disulfide connectivity pattern prediction,\nparticularly for the proteins of higher-order connections, e.g., >3 bonds, is too\nlow to effectively assist structure assembly simulations.\nRESULTS: We propose a new hierarchical order reduction protocol called Cyscon for\ndisulfide-bonding prediction. The most confident disulfide bonds are first\nidentified and bonding prediction is then focused on the remaining cysteine\nresidues based on SVR training. Compared with purely machine learning-based\napproaches, Cyscon improved the average accuracy of connectivity pattern\nprediction by 21.9%. For proteins with more than 5 disulfide bonds, Cyscon\nimproved the accuracy by 585% on the benchmark set of PDBCYS. When applied to 158\nnon-redundant cysteine-rich proteins, Cyscon predictions helped increase (or\ndecrease) the TM-score (or RMSD) of the ab initio QUARK modeling by 12.1% (or\n14.4%).

This\nimplies that, unlike the rest of the protein, standard homology modeling\ntechniques are not very effective in modeling their structure. However, loops are\noften involved in protein function, hence inferring their structure is important \nfor predicting protein structure as well as function.\nRESULTS: We describe a method, LoopIng, based on the Random Forest automated\nlearning technique, which, given a target loop, selects a structural template for\nit from a database of loop candidates. Compared to the most recently available\nmethods, LoopIng is able to achieve similar accuracy for short loops (4-10\nresidues) and significant enhancements for long loops (11-20 residues). The\nquality of the predictions is robust to errors that unavoidably affect the stem\nregions when these are modeled.

SUMO proteins are conjugated to a protein substrate, creating\nan interface for the recruitment of cofactors harboring SUMO-interacting motifs\n(SIMs). Mapping both SUMO-conjugation sites and SIMs is required to study the\nfunctional consequence of SUMOylation. To define the best candidate sites for\nexperimental validation we designed JASSA, a Joint Analyzer of SUMOylation site\nand SIMs.\nRESULTS: JASSA is a predictor that uses a scoring system based on a Position\nFrequency Matrix derived from the alignment of experimental SUMOylation sites or \nSIMs. Compared with existing web-tools, JASSA displays on par or better\nperformances. Novel features were implemented towards a better evaluation of the \nprediction, including identification of database hits matching the query sequence\nand representation of candidate sites within the secondary structural elements\nand/or the 3D fold of the protein of interest, retrievable from deposited PDB\nfiles.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: JASSA is freely accessible at\nhttp://www.jassa.fr/.

This technique has been extensively used in many areas of\nbiology but is particularly useful for studying the spread of quickly evolving\ninfectious diseases agents, e.g. influenza virus. Phylodynamic inference uses a\ncoalescent model that defines a probability density for the genealogy of randomly\nsampled individuals from the population. When we assume that such a genealogy is \nknown, the coalescent model, equipped with a Gaussian process prior on population\nsize trajectory, allows for nonparametric Bayesian estimation of population size \ndynamics. Although this approach is quite powerful, large datasets collected\nduring infectious disease surveillance challenge the state-of-the-art of Bayesian\nphylodynamics and demand inferential methods with relatively low computational\ncost.\nRESULTS: To satisfy this demand, we provide a computationally efficient Bayesian \ninference framework based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for coalescent process\nmodels. Moreover, we show that by splitting the Hamiltonian function, we can\nfurther improve the efficiency of this approach. Using several simulated and real\ndatasets, we show that our method provides accurate estimates of population size \ndynamics and is substantially faster than alternative methods based on elliptical\nslice sampler and Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R code for all simulation studies and real\ndata analysis conducted in this article are publicly available at\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/∼slan/lanzi/CODES.html and in the R package phylodyn\navailable at https://github.com/mdkarcher/phylodyn.\nCONTACT: S.Lan@warwick.ac.uk or babaks@uci.edu\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.

TA proteins account for approximately 3-5 % of all transmembrane\nproteins that mediate membrane fusion, regulation of apoptosis, and vesicular\ntransport. The combined use of TMD and signal sequence prediction tools is\ntypically required to predict TA proteins.\nRESULTS: Here we developed a prediction system named TAPPM that predicted TA\nproteins solely from target amino acid sequences according to the knowledge of\nthe sequence features of TMDs and the peripheral regions of TA proteins. Manually\ncurated TA proteins were collected from published literature. We constructed\nhidden markov models of TA proteins as well as three different types of\ntransmembrane proteins with similar structures and compared their likelihoods as \nTA proteins.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using the HMM models, we achieved high prediction accuracy; area\nunder the receiver operator curve values reaching 0.963.

The\nscale of these projects are far beyond the capacity of typical computing\nresources available with most research labs. Other infrastructures like the cloud\nAWS environment and supercomputers also have limitations due to which large scale\njoint variant calling becomes infeasible, and infrastructure specific variant\ncalling strategies either fail to scale up to large datasets or abandon joint\ncalling strategies.\nRESULTS: We present a high throughput framework including multiple variant\ncallers for single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling, which leverages hybrid\ncomputing infrastructure consisting of cloud AWS, supercomputers and local high\nperformance computing infrastructures. We present a novel binning approach for\nlarge scale joint variant calling and imputation which can scale up to over\n10,000 samples while producing SNV callsets with high sensitivity and\nspecificity. As a proof of principle, we present results of analysis on Cohorts\nfor Heart And Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) WGS freeze 3\ndataset in which joint calling, imputation and phasing of over 5300 whole genome \nsamples was produced in under 6 weeks using four state-of-the-art callers. The\ncallers used were SNPTools, GATK-HaplotypeCaller, GATK-UnifiedGenotyper and\nGotCloud. We used Amazon AWS, a 4000-core in-house cluster at Baylor College of\nMedicine, IBM power PC Blue BioU at Rice and Rhea at Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory (ORNL) for the computation. AWS was used for joint calling of 180 TB\nof BAM files, and ORNL and Rice supercomputers were used for the imputation and\nphasing step. All other steps were carried out on the local compute cluster. The \nentire operation used 5.2 million core hours and only transferred a total of 6 TB\nof data across the platforms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Even with increasing sizes of whole genome datasets, ensemble joint \ncalling of SNVs for low coverage data can be accomplished in a scalable, cost\neffective and fast manner by using heterogeneous computing platforms without\ncompromising on the quality of variants.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1211-6 \nPMCID: PMC5018196\nPMID: 27612449  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

These data provide us with many answers, but raise just as\nmany questions. 16S rDNA-the backbone of microbiome analyses-allows us to assess \nα-diversity, β-diversity, and microbe-microbe associations, which characterize\nthe overall properties of an ecosystem. However, we are still unable to use 16S\nrDNA data to directly assess the microbe-microbe and microbe-environment\ninteractions that determine the broader ecology of that system. Thus, properties \nsuch as competition, cooperation, and nutrient conditions remain insufficiently\nanalyzed. Here, we apply predictive community metabolic models of microbes\nidentified with 16S rDNA data to probe the ecology of microbial communities.\nRESULTS: We developed a methodology for the large-scale assessment of microbial\nmetabolic interactions (MMinte) from 16S rDNA data. MMinte assesses the relative \ngrowth rates of interacting pairs of organisms within a community metabolic\nnetwork and whether that interaction has a positive or negative effect. Moreover,\nMMinte's simulations take into account the nutritional environment, which plays a\nstrong role in determining the metabolism of individual microbes. We present two \ncase studies that demonstrate the utility of this software. In the first, we show\nhow diet influences the nature of the microbe-microbe interactions. In the\nsecond, we use MMinte's modular feature set to better understand how the growth\nof Desulfovibrio piger is affected by, and affects the growth of, other members\nin a simplified gut community under metabolic conditions suggested to be\ndeterminant for their dynamics.\nCONCLUSION: By applying metabolic models to commonly available sequence data,\nMMinte grants the user insight into the metabolic relationships between microbes,\nhighlighting important features that may relate to ecological stability,\nsusceptibility, and cross-feeding. These relationships are at the foundation of a\nwide range of ecological questions that impact our ability to understand problems\nsuch as microbially-derived toxicity in colon cancer.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1230-3 \nPMCID: PMC5009493\nPMID: 27590448  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Subsequent bioinformatic\nanalysis is typically done with the help of open source tools, where each\napplication performs a single step towards the final result. This situation\nleaves the bioinformaticians with the tasks to combine the tools, manage the data\nfiles and meta-information, document the analysis, and ensure reproducibility.\nRESULTS: We present SUSHI, an agile data analysis framework that relieves\nbioinformaticians from the administrative challenges of their data analysis.\nSUSHI lets users build reproducible data analysis workflows from individual\napplications and manages the input data, the parameters, meta-information with\nuser-driven semantics, and the job scripts. As distinguishing features, SUSHI\nprovides an expert command line interface as well as a convenient web interface\nto run bioinformatics tools. SUSHI datasets are self-contained and\nself-documented on the file system. This makes them fully reproducible and ready \nto be shared. With the associated meta-information being formatted as plain text \ntables, the datasets can be readily further analyzed and interpreted outside\nSUSHI.\nCONCLUSION: SUSHI provides an exquisite recipe for analysing NGS data. By\nfollowing the SUSHI recipe, SUSHI makes data analysis straightforward and takes\ncare of documentation and administration tasks. Thus, the user can fully dedicate\nhis time to the analysis itself. SUSHI is suitable for use by bioinformaticians\nas well as life science researchers. It is targeted for, but by no means\nconstrained to, NGS data analysis.

Denoising, the removal of \nsequencing errors, is an important step in preprocessing amplicon sequencing\ndata. The increasing popularity of the Illumina MiSeq platform for these\napplications requires the development of appropriate denoising methods.\nRESULTS: The newly proposed denoising algorithm IPED includes a machine learning \nmethod which predicts potentially erroneous positions in sequencing reads based\non a combination of quality metrics. Subsequently, this information is used to\ngroup those error-containing reads with correct reads, resulting in error-free\nconsensus reads. This is achieved by masking potentially erroneous positions\nduring this clustering step. Compared to the second best algorithm available,\nIPED detects double the amount of errors. Reducing the error rate had a positive \neffect on the clustering of reads in operational taxonomic units, with an almost \nperfect correspondence between the number of clusters and the theoretical number \nof species present in the mock communities.\nCONCLUSION: Our algorithm IPED is a powerful denoising tool for correcting\nsequencing errors in Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data. Apart\nfrom significantly reducing the error rate of the sequencing reads, it has also a\nbeneficial effect on their clustering into operational taxonomic units.

GOexpress integrates normalised gene expression\ndata (e.g., from microarray and RNA-seq experiments) and phenotypic information\nof individual samples with gene ontology annotations to derive a ranking of genes\nand gene ontology terms using a supervised learning approach. The default random \nforest algorithm allows interactions between all experimental factors, and\ncompetitive scoring of expressed genes to evaluate their relative importance in\nclassifying predefined groups of samples.\nCONCLUSIONS: GOexpress enables rapid identification and visualisation of\nontology-related gene panels that robustly classify groups of samples and\nsupports both categorical (e.g., infection status, treatment) and continuous\n(e.g., time-series, drug concentrations) experimental factors. The use of\nstandard Bioconductor extension packages and publicly available gene ontology\nannotations facilitates straightforward integration of GOexpress within existing \ncomputational biology pipelines.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0971-3 \nPMCID: PMC4788925\nPMID: 26968614  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Two software packages are widely used in analysis of\nsubstructure: Structure and Eigenstrat. Structure assigns each individual to a\npopulation by using a Bayesian method with multiple tuning parameters. It\nrequires considerable computational time when dealing with thousands of samples\nand lacks the ability to create scores that could be used as covariates.\nEigenstrat uses a principal component analysis method to model all sources of\nsampling variation. However, it does not readily provide information directly\nrelevant to ancestral origin; the eigenvectors generated by Eigenstrat are sample\nspecific and thus cannot be generalized to other individuals.\nRESULTS: We developed FastPop, an efficient R package that fills the gap between \nStructure and Eigenstrat. It can: 1, generate PCA scores that identify ancestral \norigins and can be used for multiple studies; 2, infer ancestry information for\ndata arising from two or more intercontinental origins. We demonstrate the use of\nFastPop using 2318 SNP markers selected from the genome based on high variability\namong European, Asian and West African (African) populations. We conducted an\nanalysis of 505 Hapmap samples with European, African or Asian ancestry along\nwith 19661 additional samples of unknown ancestry. The results from FastPop are\nhighly consistent with those obtained by Structure across the 19661 samples we\nstudied. The correlations of the results between FastPop and Structure are 0.99, \n0.97 and 0.99 for European, African and Asian ancestry scores, respectively.\nCompared with Structure, FastPop is more efficient as it finished ancestry\ninference for 19661 samples in 16 min compared with 21-24 h required by\nStructure. FastPop also provided scores based on SNP weights so the scores of\nreference population can be applied to other studies provided the same set of\nmarkers are used. We also present application of the method for studying four\ncontinental populations (European, Asian, African, and Native American).\nCONCLUSIONS: We developed an algorithm that can infer ancestries on data\ninvolving two or more intercontinental origins. It is efficient for analyzing\nlarge datasets. Additionally the PCA derived scores can be applied to multiple\ndata sets to ensure the same ancestry analysis is applied to all studies.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0965-1 \nPMCID: PMC4784403\nPMID: 26961892  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Aligning\nbisulfite-treated reads, however, is a computationally difficult task: bisulfite \ntreatment decreases the (lexical) complexity of low-methylated genomic regions,\nand C-to-T mismatches may reflect cytosine unmethylation rather than SNPs or\nsequencing errors. Further challenges arise both during and after the alignment\nphase: data structures used by the aligner should be fast and should fit into\nmain memory, and the methylation-caller output should be somehow compressed, due \nto its significant size.\nMETHODS: As far as data structures employed to align bisulfite-treated reads are \nconcerned, solutions proposed in the literature can be roughly grouped into two\nmain categories: those storing pointers at each text position (e.g. hash tables, \nsuffix trees/arrays), and those using the information-theoretic minimum number of\nbits (e.g. FM indexes and compressed suffix arrays). The former are fast and\nmemory consuming. The latter are much slower and light. In this paper, we try to \nclose this gap proposing a data structure for aligning bisulfite-treated reads\nwhich is at the same time fast, light, and very accurate. We reach this objective\nby combining a recent theoretical result on succinct hashing with a\nbisulfite-aware hash function. Furthermore, the new versions of the tools\nimplementing our ideas|the aligner ERNE-BS5 2 and the caller ERNE-METH 2|have\nbeen extended with increased downstream compatibility (EPP/Bismark cov output\nformats), output compression, and support for target enrichment protocols.\nRESULTS: Experimental results on public and simulated WGBS libraries show that\nour algorithmic solution is a competitive tradeoff between hash-based and\nBWT-based indexes, being as fast and accurate as the former, and as\nmemory-efficient as the latter.\nCONCLUSIONS: The new functionalities of our bisulfite aligner and caller make it \na fast and memory efficient tool, useful to analyze big datasets with little\ncomputational resources, to easily process target enrichment data, and produce\nstatistics such as protocol efficiency and coverage as a function of the distance\nfrom target regions.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0910-3 \nPMCID: PMC4896272\nPMID: 26961371  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We use synthetic data to evaluate D(3)E, demonstrating that it can \ndetect changes in expression, even when the mean level remains unchanged. Since\nD(3)E is based on an analytically tractable stochastic model, it provides\nadditional biological insights by quantifying biologically meaningful properties,\nsuch as the average burst size and frequency. We use D(3)E to investigate\nexperimental data, and with the help of the underlying model, we directly test\nhypotheses about the driving mechanism behind changes in gene expression.\nCONCLUSION: Evaluation using synthetic data shows that D(3)E performs better than\nother methods for identifying differentially expressed genes since it is designed\nto take full advantage of the information available from single-cell RNA-seq\nexperiments.

However, little is known about such\nelements in protists. The evolutionary distance between apicomplexans can be very\nhigh, in particular, due to the positive selection pressure on them. This\ncomplicates the identification of highly conserved elements in alveolates, which \nis overcome by the proposed algorithm.\nRESULTS: A novel algorithm is developed to identify highly conserved DNA\nelements. It is based on the identification of dense subgraphs in a specially\nbuilt multipartite graph (whose parts correspond to genomes). Specifically, the\nalgorithm does not rely on genome alignments, nor pre-identified perfectly\nconserved elements; instead, it performs a fast search for pairs of words (in\ndifferent genomes) of maximum length with the difference below the specified edit\ndistance. Such pair defines an edge whose weight equals the maximum (or total)\nlength of words assigned to its ends. The graph composed of these edges is then\ncompacted by merging some of its edges and vertices. The dense subgraphs are\nidentified by a cellular automaton-like algorithm; each subgraph defines a\ncluster composed of similar inextensible words from different genomes. Almost all\nclusters are considered as predicted highly conserved elements. The algorithm is \napplied to the nuclear genomes of the superphylum Alveolata, and the\ncorresponding phylogenetic tree is built and discussed.\nCONCLUSION: We proposed an algorithm for the identification of highly conserved\nelements. The multitude of identified elements was used to infer the phylogeny of\nAlveolata.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1257-5 \nPMCID: PMC5028923\nPMID: 27645252  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

However, few theoretical\nmodels have tried to explain these facts comprehensively. Here, we propose a\nsensorimotor learning and control model that can be used to (1) predict the\ndynamics of variable time delays and current and future sensory states from\ndelayed sensory information; (2) learn new sensorimotor realities; and (3)\ncontrol a motor system in real time.\nRESULTS: This paper proposed a new time-delay estimation method and developed a\ncomputational model for a predictive control solution of a sensorimotor control\nsystem under time delay. Simulation experiments are used to demonstrate how the\nproposed model can explain a sensorimotor system's ability to compensate for\ndelays during online learning and control. To further illustrate the benefits of \nthe proposed time-delay estimation method and predictive control in sensorimotor \nsystems a simulation of the horizontal Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (hVOR) system is\npresented. Without the proposed time-delay estimation and prediction, the hVOR\ncan be unstable and could be affected by high frequency oscillations. These\noscillations are reminiscent of a fast correction mechanism, e.g., a saccade to\ncompensate for the hVOR delays. Comparing results of the proposed model with\nthose in literature, it is clear that the hVOR system with impaired time-delay\nestimation or impaired sensory state predictor can mimic certain outcomes of\nsensorimotor diseases. Even more, if the control of hVOR is augmented with the\nproposed time-delay estimator and the predictor for eye position relative to the \nhead, then hVOR control system can be stabilized.\nCONCLUSIONS: Three claims with varying degrees of experimental support are\nproposed in this paper. Firstly, the brain or any sensorimotor system has\ntime-delay estimation circuits for the various sensorimotor control systems.\nSecondly, the brain continuously estimates current/future sensory states from the\npreviously sensed states. Thirdly, the brain uses predicted sensory states to\nperform optimal motor control.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1098-2 \nPMCID: PMC4965729\nPMID: 27454449  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Reconstructed cryo-ET images have a \"missing wedge\" of\ndata loss due to limitations in rotation of the mounting stage. Most current\napproaches for structure determination improve cryo-ET resolution either by some \nform of sub-tomogram averaging or template matching, respectively precluding\ndetection of shapes that vary across objects or are a priori unknown. Various\nmacromolecular structures possess polyhedral structure. We propose a\nclassification method for polyhedral shapes from incomplete individual cryo-ET\nreconstructions, based on topological features of an extracted polyhedral graph\n(PG).\nRESULTS: We outline a pipeline for extracting PG from 3-D cryo-ET\nreconstructions. For classification, we construct a reference library of regular \npolyhedra. Using geometric simulation, we construct a non-parametric estimate of \nthe distribution of possible incomplete PGs. In studies with simulated data, a\nBayes classifier constructed using these distributions has an average test set\nmisclassification error of < 5 % with upto 30 % of the object missing, suggesting\naccurate polyhedral shape classification is possible from individual incomplete\ncryo-ET reconstructions. We also demonstrate how the method can be made robust to\nmis-specification of the PG using an SVM based classifier. The methodology is\napplied to cryo-ET reconstructions of 30 micro-compartments isolated from E. coli\nbacteria.\nCONCLUSIONS: The predicted shapes aren't unique, but all belong to the\nnon-symmetric Johnson solid family, illustrating the potential of this approach\nto study variation in polyhedral macromolecular structures.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1107-5 \nPMCID: PMC4904361\nPMID: 27296169  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Current\npeak callers are often hard to parameterise and may therefore be difficult to use\nfor non-bioinformaticians. In this paper, we present the ChIP-seq analysis tool\navailable in CLC Genomics Workbench and CLC Genomics Server (version 7.5 and up),\na user-friendly peak-caller designed to be not specific to a particular *-seq\nprotocol.\nRESULTS: We illustrate the advantages of a shape-based approach and describe the \nalgorithmic principles underlying the implementation. Thanks to the generality of\nthe idea and the fact the algorithm is able to learn the peak shape from the\ndata, the implementation requires only minimal user input, while still being\napplicable to a range of *-seq protocols. Using independently validated benchmark\ndatasets, we compare our implementation to other state-of-the-art algorithms\nexplicitly designed to analyse ChIP-seq data and provide an evaluation in terms\nof receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) plots. In order to show the\napplicability of the method to similar *-seq protocols, we also investigate\nalgorithmic performances on DNase-seq data.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results show that CLC shape-based peak caller ranks well among\npopular state-of-the-art peak callers while providing flexibility and\nease-of-use.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-1042-5 \nPMCID: PMC4905608\nPMID: 27295177  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

(2)Department of Biology and\nBiochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, TX, 77204-5001, USA.\nkezawa.ezawa3@gmail.com.\n\nBACKGROUND: Reconstruction of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) is a crucial\nstep in most homology-based sequence analyses, which constitute an integral part \nof computational biology. To improve the accuracy of this crucial step, it is\nessential to better characterize errors that state-of-the-art aligners typically \nmake. For this purpose, we here introduce two tools: the complete-likelihood\nscore and the position-shift map.\nRESULTS: The logarithm of the total probability of a MSA under a stochastic model\nof sequence evolution along a time axis via substitutions, insertions and\ndeletions (called the \"complete-likelihood score\" here) can serve as an ideal\nscore of the MSA. A position-shift map, which maps the difference in each\nresidue's position between two MSAs onto one of them, can clearly visualize where\nand how MSA errors occurred and help disentangle composite errors. To\ncharacterize MSA errors using these tools, we constructed three sets of simulated\nMSAs of selectively neutral mammalian DNA sequences, with small, moderate and\nlarge divergences, under a stochastic evolutionary model with an empirically\ncommon power-law insertion/deletion length distribution. Then, we reconstructed\nMSAs using MAFFT and Prank as representative state-of-the-art\nsingle-optimum-search aligners. About 40-99% of the hundreds of thousands of\ngapped segments were involved in alignment errors. In a substantial fraction,\nfrom about 1/4 to over 3/4, of erroneously reconstructed segments, reconstructed \nMSAs by each aligner showed complete-likelihood scores not lower than those of\nthe true MSAs. Out of the remaining errors, a majority by an iterative option of \nMAFFT showed discrepancies between the aligner-specific score and the\ncomplete-likelihood score, and a majority by Prank seemed due to inadequate\nexploration of the MSA space. Analyses by position-shift maps indicated that true\nMSAs are in considerable neighborhoods of reconstructed MSAs in about 80-99% of\nthe erroneous segments for small and moderate divergences, but in only a minority\nfor large divergences.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that measures to further improve\nthe accuracy of reconstructed MSAs would substantially differ depending on the\ntypes of aligners. They also re-emphasize the importance of obtaining a\nprobability distribution of fairly likely MSAs, instead of just searching for a\nsingle optimum MSA.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0945-5 \nPMCID: PMC4799563\nPMID: 26992851  [PubMed - in process]\n\n",

Drug repositioning is the current trend in the pharmaceutical\nindustry for identifying potential new uses for existing drugs and accelerating\nthe development process of drugs, as well as reducing side effects.\nRESULTS: This work integrates two approaches--machine learning algorithms and\ntopological parameter-based classification--to develop a novel pipeline of drug\nrepositioning to analyze four lung cancer microarray datasets, enriched\nbiological processes, potential therapeutic drugs and targeted genes for NSCLC\ntreatments. A total of 7 (8) and 11 (12) promising drugs (targeted genes) were\ndiscovered for treating early- and late-stage NSCLC, respectively. The\neffectiveness of these drugs is supported by the literature, experimentally\ndetermined in-vitro IC50 and clinical trials. This work provides better drug\nprediction accuracy than competitive research according to IC50 measurements.\nCONCLUSIONS: With the novel pipeline of drug repositioning, the discovery of\nenriched pathways and potential drugs related to NSCLC can provide insight into\nthe key regulators of tumorigenesis and the treatment of NSCLC. Based on the\nverified effectiveness of the targeted drugs predicted by this pipeline, we\nsuggest that our drug-finding pipeline is effective for repositioning drugs.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0845-0 \nPMCID: PMC4895785\nPMID: 26817825  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

As contrasted to a population averaged\nreference this reference sample is individualized. Automated predictor algorithms\nthat compare and contrast the paired samples to each other could result in a new \ngeneration of test panels that compare to a person's healthy reference to enhance\npredictive accuracy. This paper develops such an individualized predictor and\nillustrates the added value of including the healthy reference for design of\npredictive gene expression panels.\nRESULTS: The objective is to predict each subject's state of infection, e.g.,\nneither exposed nor infected, exposed but not infected, pre-acute phase of\ninfection, acute phase of infection, post-acute phase of infection. Using gene\nmicroarray data collected in a large scale serially sampled respiratory virus\nchallenge study we quantify the diagnostic advantage of pairing a person's\nbaseline reference with his or her target sample. The full study consists of 2886\nmicroarray chips assaying 12,023 genes of 151 human volunteer subjects under 4\ndifferent inoculation regimes (HRV, RSV, H1N1, H3N2). We train (with\ncross-validation) reference-aided sparse multi-class classifier algorithms on\nthis data to show that inclusion of a subject's reference sample can improve\nprediction accuracy by as much as 14 %, for the H3N2 cohort, and by at least 6 %,\nfor the H1N1 cohort. Remarkably, these gains in accuracy are achieved by using\nsmaller panels of genes, e.g., 39 % fewer for H3N2 and 31 % fewer for H1N1. The\nbiomarkers selected by the predictors fall into two categories: 1) contrasting\ngenes that tend to differentially express between target and reference samples\nover the population; 2) reinforcement genes that remain constant over the two\nsamples, which function as housekeeping normalization genes. Many of these genes \nare common to all 4 viruses and their roles in the predictor elucidate the\nfunction that they play in differentiating the different states of host immune\nresponse.\nCONCLUSIONS: If one uses a suitable mathematical prediction algorithm, inclusion \nof a healthy reference in biomarker diagnostic testing can potentially improve\naccuracy of disease prediction with fewer biomarkers.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-016-0889-9 \nPMCID: PMC4722633\nPMID: 26801061  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In spite of considerable research and\nefforts that have been recently deployed for improving the performance of\nmultiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithms, finding a highly accurate alignment\nbetween multiple protein sequences is still a challenging problem.\nRESULTS: We propose a novel and efficient algorithm called, MSAIndelFR, for\nmultiple sequence alignment using the information on the predicted locations of\nIndelFRs and the computed average log-loss values obtained from IndelFR\npredictors, each of which is designed for a different protein fold. We\ndemonstrate that the introduction of a new variable gap penalty function based on\nthe predicted locations of the IndelFRs and the computed average log-loss values \ninto the proposed algorithm substantially improves the protein alignment\naccuracy. This is illustrated by evaluating the performance of the algorithm in\naligning sequences belonging to the protein folds for which the IndelFR\npredictors already exist and by using the reference alignments of the four\npopular benchmarks, BAliBASE 3.0, OXBENCH, PREFAB 4.0, and SABRE (SABmark 1.65).\nCONCLUSIONS: We have proposed a novel and efficient algorithm, the MSAIndelFR\nalgorithm, for multiple protein sequence alignment incorporating a new variable\ngap penalty function. It is shown that the performance of the proposed algorithm \nis superior to that of the most-widely used alignment algorithms, Clustal W2,\nClustal Omega, Kalign2, MSAProbs, MAFFT, MUSCLE, ProbCons and Probalign, in terms\nof both the sum-of-pairs and total column metrics.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0826-3 \nPMCID: PMC4657235\nPMID: 26597571  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The position weight matrix (PWM) model,\nwhich assumes statistical independence among all nucleotides in a binding site,\nused to be the standard model for this task for more than three decades but its\nsimple assumptions are increasingly put into question. Recent high-throughput\nsequencing methods have provided data sets of sufficient size and quality for\nstudying the benefits of more complex models. However, learning more complex\nmodels typically entails the danger of overfitting, and while model classes that \ndynamically adapt the model complexity to data have been developed, effective\nmodel selection is to date only possible for fully observable data, but not,\ne.g., within de novo motif discovery.\nRESULTS: To address this issue, we propose a stochastic algorithm for performing \nrobust model selection in a latent variable setting. This algorithm yields a\nsolution without relying on hyperparameter-tuning via massive cross-validation or\nother computationally expensive resampling techniques. Using this algorithm for\nlearning inhomogeneous parsimonious Markov models, we study the degree of\nputative higher-order intra-motif dependencies for transcription factor binding\nsites inferred via de novo motif discovery from ChIP-seq data. We find that\nintra-motif dependencies are prevalent and not limited to first-order\ndependencies among directly adjacent nucleotides, but that second-order models\nappear to be the significantly better choice.\nCONCLUSIONS: The traditional PWM model appears to be indeed insufficient to infer\nrealistic sequence motifs, as it is on average outperformed by more complex\nmodels that take into account intra-motif dependencies. Moreover, using such\nmodels together with an appropriate model selection procedure does not lead to a \nsignificant performance loss in comparison with the PWM model for any of the\nstudied transcription factors. Hence, we find it worthwhile to recommend that any\nmodern motif discovery algorithm should attempt to take into account intra-motif \ndependencies.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0797-4 \nPMCID: PMC4640111\nPMID: 26552868  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Here we explore the consequences of \"batch\"\ncorrection for biological discovery in two publicly available expression\ndatasets. We consider this to include the estimation of and adjustment for\nwide-spread systematic heterogeneity in genomic measurements that is unrelated to\nthe effects under study, whether it be technical or biological in nature.\nMETHODS: We present three illustrative data analyses using surrogate variable\nanalysis (SVA) and describe how to perform artifact discovery in light of natural\nheterogeneity within biological groups, secondary biological questions of\ninterest, and non-linear treatment effects in a dataset profiling differentiating\npluripotent cells (GSE32923) and another from human brain tissue (GSE30272).\nRESULTS: Careful specification of biological effects of interest is very\nimportant to factor-based approaches like SVA. We demonstrate greatly sharpened\nglobal and gene-specific differential expression across treatment groups in stem \ncell systems. Similarly, we demonstrate how to preserve major non-linear effects \nof age across the lifespan in the brain dataset. However, the gains in precisely \ndefining known effects of interest come at the cost of much other information in \nthe \"cleaned\" data, including sex, common copy number effects and sample or cell \nline-specific molecular behavior.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicate that data \"cleaning\" can be an important\ncomponent of high-throughput genomic data analysis when interrogating explicitly \ndefined effects in the context of data affected by robust technical artifacts.\nHowever, caution should be exercised to avoid removing biological signal of\ninterest. It is also important to note that open data exploration is not possible\nafter such supervised \"cleaning\", because effects beyond those stipulated by the \nresearcher may have been removed. With the goal of making these statistical\nalgorithms more powerful and transparent to researchers in the biological\nsciences, we provide exploratory plots and accompanying R code for identifying\nand guiding \"cleaning\" process (https://github.com/andrewejaffe/StemCellSVA). The\nimpact of these methods is significant enough that we have made newly processed\ndata available for the brain data set at http://braincloud.jhmi.edu/plots/ and\nGSE30272.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0808-5 \nPMCID: PMC4636836\nPMID: 26545828  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

(2)Department of\nComputer Science and Systems Engineering, University of Zaragoza, María de Luna\n1, Zaragoza, 50018, Spain. jj425@cam.ac.uk.\n\nBACKGROUND: Many biological systems exhibit sustained stochastic oscillations in \ntheir steady state. Assessing these oscillations is usually a challenging task\ndue to the potential variability of the amplitude and frequency of the\noscillations over time. As a result of this variability, when several stochastic \nreplications are averaged, the oscillations are flattened and can be overlooked. \nThis can easily lead to the erroneous conclusion that the system reaches a\nconstant steady state.\nRESULTS: This paper proposes a straightforward method to detect and asses\nstochastic oscillations. The basis of the method is in the use of polar\ncoordinates for systems with two species, and cylindrical coordinates for systems\nwith more than two species. By slightly modifying these coordinate systems, it is\npossible to compute the total angular distance run by the system and the average \nEuclidean distance to a reference point. This allows us to compute confidence\nintervals, both for the average angular speed and for the distance to a reference\npoint, from a set of replications.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of polar (or cylindrical) coordinates provides a new\nperspective of the system dynamics. The mean trajectory that can be obtained by\naveraging the usual cartesian coordinates of the samples informs about the\ntrajectory of the center of mass of the replications. In contrast to such a mean \ncartesian trajectory, the mean polar trajectory can be used to compute the\naverage circular motion of those replications, and therefore, can yield evidence \nabout sustained steady state oscillations. Both, the coordinate transformation\nand the computation of confidence intervals, can be carried out efficiently. This\nresults in an efficient method to evaluate stochastic oscillations.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0765-z \nPMCID: PMC4615616\nPMID: 26482438  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Many aspects of\nthe lesion under consideration are defined in relation to the lesion border. This\nmakes border detection one of the most important steps in dermoscopic image\nanalysis. In current practice, dermatologists often delineate borders through a\nhand drawn representation based upon visual inspection. Due to the subjective\nnature of this technique, intra- and inter-observer variations are common.\nBecause of this, the automated assessment of lesion borders in dermoscopic images\nhas become an important area of study.\nMETHODS: Fast density based skin lesion border detection method has been\nimplemented in parallel with a new parallel technology called WebCL. WebCL\nutilizes client side computing capabilities to use available hardware resources\nsuch as multi cores and GPUs. Developed WebCL-parallel density based skin lesion \nborder detection method runs efficiently from internet browsers.\nRESULTS: Previous research indicates that one of the highest accuracy rates can\nbe achieved using density based clustering techniques for skin lesion border\ndetection. While these algorithms do have unfavorable time complexities, this\neffect could be mitigated when implemented in parallel. In this study, density\nbased clustering technique for skin lesion border detection is parallelized and\nredesigned to run very efficiently on the heterogeneous platforms (e.g. tablets, \nSmartPhones, multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and fully-integrated Accelerated Processing\nUnits) by transforming the technique into a series of independent concurrent\noperations. Heterogeneous computing is adopted to support accessibility,\nportability and multi-device use in the clinical settings. For this, we used\nWebCL, an emerging technology that enables a HTML5 Web browser to execute code in\nparallel for heterogeneous platforms. We depicted WebCL and our parallel\nalgorithm design. In addition, we tested parallel code on 100 dermoscopy images\nand showed the execution speedups with respect to the serial version. Results\nindicate that parallel (WebCL) version and serial version of density based lesion\nborder detection methods generate the same accuracy rates for 100 dermoscopy\nimages, in which mean of border error is 6.94%, mean of recall is 76.66%, and\nmean of precision is 99.29% respectively. Moreover, WebCL version's speedup\nfactor for 100 dermoscopy images' lesion border detection averages around ~491.2.\nCONCLUSIONS: When large amount of high resolution dermoscopy images considered in\na usual clinical setting along with the critical importance of early detection\nand diagnosis of melanoma before metastasis, the importance of fast processing\ndermoscopy images become obvious. In this paper, we introduce WebCL and the use\nof it for biomedical image processing applications. WebCL is a javascript binding\nof OpenCL, which takes advantage of GPU computing from a web browser. Therefore, \nWebCL parallel version of density based skin lesion border detection introduced\nin this study can supplement expert dermatologist, and aid them in early\ndiagnosis of skin lesions. While WebCL is currently an emerging technology, a\nfull adoption of WebCL into the HTML5 standard would allow for this\nimplementation to run on a very large set of hardware and software systems. WebCL\ntakes full advantage of parallel computational resources including multi-cores\nand GPUs on a local machine, and allows for compiled code to run directly from\nthe Web Browser.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S13-S5 \nPMCID: PMC4596977\nPMID: 26423836  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

However, the task of automatic\ndetection of the glomeruli poses challenges owing to the differences in their\nsizes and shapes in renal sections as well as the extensive variations in their\nintensities due to heterogeneity in immunohistochemistry staining. Although the\nrectangular histogram of oriented gradients (Rectangular HOG) is a widely\nrecognized powerful descriptor for general object detection, it shows many false \npositives owing to the aforementioned difficulties in the context of glomeruli\ndetection.\nRESULTS: A new descriptor referred to as Segmental HOG was developed to perform a\ncomprehensive detection of hundreds of glomeruli in images of whole kidney\nsections. The new descriptor possesses flexible blocks that can be adaptively\nfitted to input images in order to acquire robustness for the detection of the\nglomeruli. Moreover, the novel segmentation technique employed herewith generates\nhigh-quality segmentation outputs, and the algorithm is assured to converge to an\noptimal solution. Consequently, experiments using real-world image data revealed \nthat Segmental HOG achieved significant improvements in detection performance\ncompared to Rectangular HOG.\nCONCLUSION: The proposed descriptor for glomeruli detection presents promising\nresults, and it is expected to be useful in pathological evaluation.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0739-1 \nPMCID: PMC4590714\nPMID: 26423821  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The design of\nGRAPHIE is guided by domain experts' requirements and well-known InfoVis mantras.\nBy representing each image with informative features and then subsequently\nvisualizing the image collection with a graph, GRAPHIE allows users to\neffectively explore the image collection. The features were designed to capture\nlocalized morphological properties in the given tissue specimen. More\nimportantly, users can perform feature selection in an interactive way to improve\nthe visualization of the image collection and the overall annotation process.\nFinally, the annotation allows for a better prospective examination of datasets\nas demonstrated in the users study.

These data are far from being functionally\ncharacterized, despite the advances in gene (or gene's product proteins)\nfunctional annotations. Due to experimental techniques and to the research bias\nin biology, the regularly updated functional annotation databases, i.e., the Gene\nOntology (GO), are far from being complete. Given the importance of protein\nfunctions for biological studies and drug design, proteins should be more\ncomprehensively and precisely annotated.\nRESULTS: We proposed downward Random Walks (dRW) to predict missing (or new)\nfunctions of partially annotated proteins. Particularly, we apply downward random\nwalks with restart on the GO directed acyclic graph, along with the available\nfunctions of a protein, to estimate the probability of missing functions. To\nfurther boost the prediction accuracy, we extend dRW to dRW-kNN. dRW-kNN computes\nthe semantic similarity between proteins based on the functional annotations of\nproteins; it then predicts functions based on the functions estimated by dRW,\ntogether with the functions associated with the k nearest proteins. Our proposed \nmodels can predict two kinds of missing functions: (i) the ones that are missing \nfor a protein but associated with other proteins of interest; (ii) the ones that \nare not available for any protein of interest, but exist in the GO hierarchy.\nExperimental results on the proteins of Yeast and Human show that dRW and dRW-kNN\ncan replenish functions more accurately than other related approaches, especially\nfor sparse functions associated with no more than 10 proteins.\nCONCLUSION: The empirical study shows that the semantic similarity between GO\nterms and the ontology hierarchy play important roles in predicting protein\nfunction. The proposed dRW and dRW-kNN can serve as tools for replenishing\nfunctions of partially annotated proteins.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0713-y \nPMCID: PMC4551531\nPMID: 26310806  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The Genia Event (GE) task was\nre-designed and implemented in light of this theme. For its final report, the\nparticipating systems were evaluated from a perspective of annotation. To further\nexplore the grand theme, we extended the evaluation from a perspective of KB\nconstruction. Also, the Gene Regulation Ontology (GRO) task was newly introduced \nin the third edition. The final evaluation of the participating systems resulted \nin relatively low performance. The reason was attributed to the large size and\ncomplex semantic representation of the ontology. To investigate potential\nbenefits of resource exchange between the presumably similar tasks, we measured\nthe overlap between the datasets of the two tasks, and tested whether the dataset\nfor one task can be used to enhance performance on the other.\nRESULTS: We report an extended evaluation on all the participating systems in the\nGE task, incoporating a KB perspective. For the evaluation, the final submission \nof each participant was converted to RDF statements, and evaluated using 8\nqueries that were formulated in SPARQL. The results suggest that the evaluation\nmay be concluded differently between the two different perspectives, annotation\nvs. KB. We also provide a comparison of the GE and GRO tasks by converting their \ndatasets into each other's format. More than 90% of the GE data could be\nconverted into the GRO task format, while only half of the GRO data could be\nmapped to the GE task format. The imbalance in conversion indicates that the GRO \nis a comprehensive extension of the GE task ontology. We further used the\nconverted GRO data as additional training data for the GE task, which helped\nimprove GE task participant system performance.

In this scenario DNA pooling is an attractive\noption to reduce genotyping costs. However, genotyping of pooled samples\ncomprising DNA from many individuals is challenging due to the presence of errors\nthat exceed the allele frequency quantisation size and therefore cannot be simply\ncorrected by clustering techniques. The solution to the calibration problem is a \ncorrection to the allele frequency to mitigate errors incurred in the measurement\nprocess. We highlight the limitations of the existing calibration solutions such \nas the fact they impose assumptions on the variation between allele frequencies\n0, 0.5, and 1.0, and address a limited set of error types. We propose a novel\nmachine learning method to address the limitations identified.\nRESULTS: The approach is tested on SNPs genotyped with the Sequenom iPLEX\nplatform and compared to existing state of the art calibration methods. The new\nmethod is capable of reducing the mean square error in allele frequency to half\nthat achievable with existing approaches. Furthermore for the first time we\ndemonstrate the importance of carefully considering the choice of training data\nwhen using calibration approaches built from pooled data.\nCONCLUSION: This paper demonstrates that improvements in pooled allele frequency \nestimates result if the genotyping platform is characterised at allele\nfrequencies other than the homozygous and heterozygous cases. Techniques capable \nof incorporating such information are described along with aspects of\nimplementation.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0593-1 \nPMCID: PMC4495942\nPMID: 26156142  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Members of this family\nmodulate physical and chemical properties of secondary plant products important\nfor various physiological processes. The role of SGTs has been demonstrated in\nthe biosynthesis of pharmaceutically important molecules of medicinal plants like\nWithania somnifera.\nRESULTS: Analysis suggested conserved behaviour and high similarity in active\nsites of WsSGTs with other plant GTs. Substrate specificity of WsSGTs were\nanalysed through docking performance of WsSGTs with different substrates (sterols\nand withanolides). Best docking results of WsSGTL1 in the form of stable\nenzyme-substrate complex having lowest binding energies were obtained with\nbrassicasterol, transandrosteron and WsSGTL4 with solasodine, stigmasterol and\n24-methylene cholesterol.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals topological characters and conserved nature of two\nSGTs from W. somnifera (WsSGTs) i.e. WsSGTL1 and WsSGTL4. However, besides being \nubiquitous in nature and with broad substrate specificity, difference between\nWsSGTL1 and WsSGTL4 is briefly described by difference in stability (binding\nenergy) of enzyme-substrate complexes through comparative docking.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0563-7 \nPMCID: PMC4407318\nPMID: 25888493  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

In the past few years, researchers have\nbeen putting a great deal of effort into presenting systematic evaluations of the\ndifferent imputation algorithms. Initially, most algorithms were assessed with an\nemphasis on the accuracy of the imputation, using metrics such as the root mean\nsquared error. However, it has become clear that the success of the estimation of\nthe expression value should be evaluated in more practical terms as well. One can\nconsider, for example, the ability of the method to preserve the significant\ngenes in the dataset, or its discriminative/predictive power for\nclassification/clustering purposes.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We performed a broad analysis of the impact of five\nwell-known missing value imputation methods on three clustering and four\nclassification methods, in the context of 12 cancer gene expression datasets. We \nemployed a statistical framework, for the first time in this field, to assess\nwhether different imputation methods improve the performance of the\nclustering/classification methods. Our results suggest that the imputation\nmethods evaluated have a minor impact on the classification and downstream\nclustering analyses. Simple methods such as replacing the missing values by mean \nor the median values performed as well as more complex strategies. The datasets\nanalyzed in this study are available at http://costalab.org/Imputation/ .\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-015-0494-3 \nPMCID: PMC4350881\nPMID: 25888091  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

The ability to predict CR (on-target and\noff-target toxicities) may help in the early selection of safer therapeutically\nrelevant target antigens.\nRESULTS: We developed a methodology for the calculation of quantitative CR for\nany defined peptide epitope. Using this approach, we performed assessment of 4\ngroups of 283 currently known human MHC-class-I epitopes including\ndifferentiation antigens, overexpressed proteins, cancer-testis antigens and\nmutations displayed by tumor cells. In addition, 89 epitopes originating from\nviral sources were investigated. The natural occurrence of these epitopes in\nhuman tissues was assessed based on proteomics abundance data, while the\nprobability of their presentation by MHC-class-I molecules was modelled by the\nmethod of Keşmir et al. which combines proteasomal cleavage, TAP affinity and\nMHC-binding predictions. The results of these analyses for many previously\ndefined peptides are presented as CR indices and tissue profiles. The methodology\nthus allows for quantitative comparisons of epitopes and is suggested to be\nsuited for the assessment of epitopes of candidate antigens in an early stage of \ndevelopment of adoptive immunotherapy.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our method is implemented as a Java program,\nwith curated datasets stored in a MySQL database. It predicts all naturally\npossible self-antigens for a given sequence of a therapeutic antigen (or epitope)\nand after filtering for predicted immunogenicity outputs results as an index and \nprofile of CR to the self-antigens in 22 human tissues.

(2)Center for Bioinformatics, Saarland University, and Max Planck\nInstitute for Informatics, 66123 Saarbrücken, Germany.\n\nMOTIVATION: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a fundamental mechanism that\nenables organisms such as bacteria to directly transfer genetic material between \ndistant species. This way, bacteria can acquire new traits such as antibiotic\nresistance or pathogenic toxins. Current bioinformatics approaches focus on the\ndetection of past HGT events by exploring phylogenetic trees or genome\ncomposition inconsistencies. However, these techniques normally require the\navailability of finished and fully annotated genomes and of sufficiently large\ndeviations that allow detection and are thus not widely applicable. Especially in\noutbreak scenarios with HGT-mediated emergence of new pathogens, like the\nenterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli outbreak in Germany 2011, there is need for\nfast and precise HGT detection. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies\nfacilitate rapid analysis of unknown pathogens but, to the best of our knowledge,\nso far no approach detects HGTs directly from NGS reads.\nRESULTS: We present Daisy, a novel mapping-based tool for HGT detection. Daisy\ndetermines HGT boundaries with split-read mapping and evaluates candidate regions\nrelying on read pair and coverage information. Daisy successfully detects HGT\nregions with base pair resolution in both simulated and real data, and\noutperforms alternative approaches using a genome assembly of the reads. We see\nour approach as a powerful complement for a comprehensive analysis of HGT in the \ncontext of NGS data.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Daisy is freely available from\nhttp://github.com/ktrappe/daisy\nCONTACT: renardb@rki.de\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

However, the utility of pathway-based\nanalysis tools is hampered by undercuration and reliance on a distribution of\nsignal across all of the genes in a pathway. Methods that combine genome wide\nassociation results with genetic networks to infer the key phenotype-modulating\nsubnetworks combat these issues, but have primarily been limited to network\ndefinitions with yes/no labels for gene-gene interactions. A recent method\n(EW_dmGWAS) incorporates a biological network with weighted edge probability by\nrequiring a secondary phenotype-specific expression dataset. In this article, we \ncombine an algorithm for weighted-edge module searching and a probabilistic\ninteraction network in order to develop a method, STAMS, for recovering modules\nof genes with strong associations to the phenotype and probable biologic\ncoherence. Our method builds on EW_dmGWAS but does not require a secondary\nexpression dataset and performs better in six test cases.\nRESULTS: We show that our algorithm improves over EW_dmGWAS and standard\ngene-based analysis by measuring precision and recall of each method on\nseparately identified associations. In the Wellcome Trust Rheumatoid Arthritis\nstudy, STAMS-identified modules were more enriched for separately identified\nassociations than EW_dmGWAS (STAMS P-value 3.0 × 10(-4); EW_dmGWAS- P-value =\n0.8). We demonstrate that the area under the Precision-Recall curve is 5.9 times \nhigher with STAMS than EW_dmGWAS run on the Wellcome Trust Type 1 Diabetes data.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAMS is implemented as an R package and is\nfreely available at https://simtk.org/projects/stams CONTACT:\nrbaltman@stanford.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available \nat Bioinformatics online.\n\n© The Author 2016.

It is critical to well organize and index\nmany assembled genomes to promote future genomics studies. Burrows-Wheeler\nTransform (BWT) is an important data structure of genome indexing, which has many\nfundamental applications; however, it is still non-trivial to construct BWT for\nlarge collection of genomes, especially for highly similar or repetitive genomes.\nMoreover, the state-of-the-art approaches cannot well support scalable parallel\ncomputing owing to their incremental nature, which is a bottleneck to use modern \ncomputers to accelerate BWT construction.\nRESULTS: We propose de Bruijn branch-based BWT constructor (deBWT), a novel\nparallel BWT construction approach. DeBWT innovatively represents and organizes\nthe suffixes of input sequence with a novel data structure, de Bruijn branch\nencoding. This data structure takes the advantage of de Bruijn graph to\nfacilitate the comparison between the suffixes with long common prefix, which\nbreaks the bottleneck of the BWT construction of repetitive genomic sequences.\nMeanwhile, deBWT also uses the structure of de Bruijn graph for reducing\nunnecessary comparisons between suffixes. The benchmarking suggests that, deBWT\nis efficient and scalable to construct BWT for large dataset by parallel\ncomputing. It is well-suited to index many genomes, such as a collection of\nindividual human genomes, with multiple-core servers or clusters.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: deBWT is implemented in C language, the source\ncode is available at https://github.com/hitbc/deBWT or\nhttps://github.com/DixianZhu/deBWTContact: ydwang@hit.edu.cn\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

(2)Center for Regenerative\nBiology and Department of Animal Science, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT\n06269, USA.\n\nMOTIVATION: A growing number of studies have explored the process of\npre-implantation embryonic development of multiple mammalian species. However,\nthe conservation and variation among different species in their developmental\nprogramming are poorly defined due to the lack of effective computational methods\nfor detecting co-regularized genes that are conserved across species. The most\nsophisticated method to date for identifying conserved co-regulated genes is a\ntwo-step approach. This approach first identifies gene clusters for each species \nby a cluster analysis of gene expression data, and subsequently computes the\noverlaps of clusters identified from different species to reveal common\nsubgroups. This approach is ineffective to deal with the noise in the expression \ndata introduced by the complicated procedures in quantifying gene expression.\nFurthermore, due to the sequential nature of the approach, the gene clusters\nidentified in the first step may have little overlap among different species in\nthe second step, thus difficult to detect conserved co-regulated genes.\nRESULTS: We propose a cross-species bi-clustering approach which first denoises\nthe gene expression data of each species into a data matrix. The rows of the data\nmatrices of different species represent the same set of genes that are\ncharacterized by their expression patterns over the developmental stages of each \nspecies as columns. A novel bi-clustering method is then developed to cluster\ngenes into subgroups by a joint sparse rank-one factorization of all the data\nmatrices. This method decomposes a data matrix into a product of a column vector \nand a row vector where the column vector is a consistent indicator across the\nmatrices (species) to identify the same gene cluster and the row vector specifies\nfor each species the developmental stages that the clustered genes co-regulate.\nEfficient optimization algorithm has been developed with convergence analysis.\nThis approach was first validated on synthetic data and compared to the two-step \nmethod and several recent joint clustering methods. We then applied this approach\nto two real world datasets of gene expression during the pre-implantation\nembryonic development of the human and mouse. Co-regulated genes consistent\nbetween the human and mouse were identified, offering insights into conserved\nfunctions, as well as similarities and differences in genome activation timing\nbetween the human and mouse embryos.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R package containing the implementation of\nthe proposed method in C ++ is available at: https://github.com/JavonSun/mvbc.git\nand also at the R platform https://www.r-project.org/\nCONTACT: jinbo@engr.uconn.edu.\n\n© The Author 2016.

We present a probabilistic method for taxonomical\nclassification (PROTAX) of DNA sequences. Given a pre-defined taxonomical tree\nstructure that is partially populated by reference sequences, PROTAX decomposes\nthe probability of one to the set of all possible outcomes. PROTAX accounts for\nspecies that are present in the taxonomy but that do not have reference\nsequences, the possibility of unknown taxonomical units, as well as mislabeled\nreference sequences. PROTAX is based on a statistical multinomial regression\nmodel, and it can utilize any kind of sequence similarity measures or the outputs\nof other classifiers as predictors.\nRESULTS: We demonstrate the performance of PROTAX by using as predictors the\noutput from BLAST, the phylogenetic classification software TIPP, and the RDP\nclassifier. We show that PROTAX improves the predictions of the baseline\nimplementations of TIPP and RDP classifiers, and that it is able to combine\ncomplementary information provided by BLAST and TIPP, resulting in accurate and\nunbiased classifications even with very challenging cases such as 50% mislabeling\nof reference sequences.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Perl/R implementation of PROTAX is available at \nhttp://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/Software.htm\nCONTACT: panu.somervuo@helsinki.fi\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2016.

A key question in such microbiome studies is to identify the \nmicrobes that are associated with clinical outcomes or environmental factors.\nHowever, microbiome compositional data are highly skewed, bounded in [0,1), and\noften sparse with many zeros. In addition, the observations from repeated\nmeasures in longitudinal studies are correlated. A method that takes into account\nthese features is needed for association analysis in longitudinal microbiome\ndata.\nRESULTS: In this paper, we propose a two-part zero-inflated Beta regression model\nwith random effects (ZIBR) for testing the association between microbial\nabundance and clinical covariates for longitudinal microbiome data. The model\nincludes a logistic regression component to model presence/absence of a microbe\nin the samples and a Beta regression component to model non-zero microbial\nabundance, where each component includes a random effect to account for the\ncorrelations among the repeated measurements on the same subject. Both simulation\nstudies and the application to real microbiome data have shown that ZIBR model\noutperformed the previously used methods.

Our application\nincludes power calculation for (i) a recoded version of the two-sample\ngeneralized Wald test of the 'HMP' R-package for comparing community composition,\nand (ii) the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for comparing operational taxonomic\nunit-specific abundances between two samples (optional). The simulation-based\npower calculations make use of the Dirichlet-Multinomial model to describe and\ngenerate abundances. The web interface allows for easy specification of sample\nand effect sizes. As an illustration of our application, we compared the\nstatistical power of the two tests, with and without stratification of samples.\nWe observed that statistical power increases considerably when stratification is \nemployed, meaning that less samples are needed to detect the same effect size\nwith the same power.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The web interface is written\nin R code using Shiny (RStudio Inc., 2016) and it is available at\nhttps://fedematt.shinyapps.io/shinyMB The R code for the recoded generalized Wald\ntest can be found at https://github.com/mafed/msWaldHMP CONTACT:\nFederico.Mattiello@UGent.be.\n\n© The Author 2016.

Current mapping approaches\nlocalize m6A residues to transcript regions 100-200 nt long but cannot identify\nprecise m6A positions on a transcriptome-wide level. Here we developed m6A\nindividual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP)\nand used it to demonstrate that antibodies to m6A can induce specific mutational \nsignatures at m6A residues after ultraviolet light-induced antibody-RNA\ncross-linking and reverse transcription. We found that these antibodies similarly\ninduced mutational signatures at N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), a\nmodification found at the first nucleotide of certain mRNAs. Using these\nsignatures, we mapped m6A and m6Am at single-nucleotide resolution in human and\nmouse mRNA and identified small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) as a new class of\nm6A-containing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3453 \nPMCID: PMC4487409\nPMID: 26121403  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We present IsoTaG, a mass-independent\nchemical glycoproteomics platform for characterization of intact, metabolically\nlabeled glycopeptides at the whole-proteome scale. In IsoTaG, metabolic labeling \nof the glycoproteome is combined with (i) chemical enrichment and isotopic\nrecoding of glycopeptides to select peptides for targeted glycoproteomics using\ndirected MS and (ii) mass-independent assignment of intact glycopeptides. We\nstructurally assigned 32 N-glycopeptides and over 500 intact and fully elaborated\nO-glycopeptides from 250 proteins across three human cancer cell lines and also\ndiscovered unexpected peptide sequence polymorphisms (pSPs).

Systemic mapping of start-codon positions and\nprecise measurement of the corresponding initiation rate would transform our\nunderstanding of translational control. Here we present quantitative translation \ninitiation sequencing (QTI-seq), with which the initiating ribosomes can be\nprofiled in real time at single-nucleotide resolution. Resultant initiation maps \nnot only delineated variations of start-codon selection but also highlighted a\ndynamic range of initiation rates in response to nutrient starvation. The\nintegrated data set provided unique insights into principles of alternative\ntranslation and mechanisms controlling different aspects of translation\ninitiation. With RiboTag mice, QTI-seq permitted tissue-specific profiling of\ninitiating ribosomes in vivo. Liver cell-specific ribosome profiling uncovered a \nrobust translational reprogramming of the proteasome system in fasted mice. Our\nfindings illuminated the prevalence and dynamic nature of translational\nregulation pivotal to physiological adaptation in vivo.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3208 \nPMCID: PMC4344187\nPMID: 25486063  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Permanent memory is implemented using irreversible\nrecombinases that invert the orientation of a unit of DNA, corresponding to the\n[0,1] state of a bit. To expand the memory capacity, we have applied\nbioinformatics to identify 34 phage integrases (and their cognate attB and attP\nrecognition sites), from which we build 11 memory switches that are perfectly\northogonal to each other and the FimE and HbiF bacterial invertases. Using these \nswitches, a memory array is constructed in Escherichia coli that can record 1.375\nbytes of information. It is demonstrated that the recombinases can be layered and\nused to permanently record the transient state of a transcriptional logic gate.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3147 \nPMCID: PMC4245323\nPMID: 25344638  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We introduce a versatile\nplatform that greatly accelerates biochemical investigations into chromatin\nrecognition and signaling. This technology is based on the streamlined\nsemisynthesis of DNA-barcoded nucleosome libraries with distinct combinations of \nPTMs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of these libraries, once they have been\ntreated with purified chromatin effectors or the combined chromatin recognizing\nand modifying activities of the nuclear proteome, is followed by multiplexed\nDNA-barcode sequencing. This ultrasensitive workflow allowed us to collect\nthousands of biochemical data points revealing the binding preferences of various\nnuclear factors for PTM patterns and how preexisting PTMs, alone or\nsynergistically, affect further PTM deposition via cross-talk mechanisms. We\nanticipate that the high throughput and sensitivity of the technology will help\naccelerate the decryption of the diverse molecular controls that operate at the\nlevel of chromatin.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3022 \nPMCID: PMC4130351\nPMID: 24997861  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Gene-sets can represent\nwell-defined biological entities (e.g. metabolites) that interact in networks\n(e.g. metabolic networks), to exert their function within the cell. Data\ninterpretation can benefit from incorporating the underlying network, but there\nare currently no optimal methods that link gene-set analysis and network\nstructures.\nRESULTS: Here we present Kiwi, a new tool that processes output data from\ngene-set analysis and integrates them with a network structure such that the\ninherent connectivity between gene-sets, i.e. not simply the gene overlap,\nbecomes apparent. In two case studies, we demonstrate that standard gene-set\nanalysis points at metabolites regulated in the interrogated condition.\nNevertheless, only the integration of the interactions between these metabolites \nprovides an extra layer of information that highlights how they are tightly\nconnected in the metabolic network.\nCONCLUSIONS: Kiwi is a tool that enhances interpretability of high-throughput\ndata. It allows the users not only to discover a list of significant entities or \nprocesses as in gene-set analysis, but also to visualize whether these entities\nor processes are isolated or connected by means of their biological interaction. \nKiwi is available as a Python package at http://www.sysbio.se/kiwi and an online \ntool in the BioMet Toolbox at http://www.biomet-toolbox.org.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0408-9 \nPMCID: PMC4269931\nPMID: 25496126  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

It has been\napplied on fields such as food science, nutrition, drug discovery and systems\nbiology. For this, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been largely \napplied and many computational tools have been developed to support the analysis \nof metabolomics data. Among them, AMDIS is perhaps the most used tool for\nidentifying and quantifying metabolites. However, AMDIS generates a high number\nof false-positives and does not have an interface amenable for high-throughput\ndata analysis. Although additional computational tools have been developed for\nprocessing AMDIS results and to perform normalisations and statistical analysis\nof metabolomics data, there is not yet a single free software or package able to \nreliably identify and quantify metabolites analysed by GC-MS.\nRESULTS: Here we introduce a new algorithm, PScore, able to score peaks according\nto their likelihood of representing metabolites defined in a mass spectral\nlibrary. We implemented PScore in a R package called MetaBox and evaluated the\napplicability and potential of MetaBox by comparing its performance against AMDIS\nresults when analysing volatile organic compounds (VOC) from standard mixtures of\nmetabolites and from female and male mice faecal samples. MetaBox reported lower \npercentages of false positives and false negatives, and was able to report a\nhigher number of potential biomarkers associated to the metabolism of female and \nmale mice.\nCONCLUSIONS: Identification and quantification of metabolites is among the most\ncritical and time-consuming steps in GC-MS metabolome analysis. Here we present\nan algorithm implemented in a R package, which allows users to construct flexible\npipelines and analyse metabolomics data in a high-throughput manner.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12859-014-0374-2 \nPMCID: PMC4307155\nPMID: 25492550  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We present a statistical approach \nfor learning the recognition code of a family of transcription factors or\nRNA-binding proteins (RBPs) from high-throughput binding data. Our method, called\naffinity regression, trains on protein binding microarray (PBM) or RNAcompete\ndata to learn an interaction model between proteins and nucleic acids using only \nprotein domain and probe sequences as inputs. When trained on mouse homeodomain\nPBM profiles, our model correctly identifies residues that confer DNA-binding\nspecificity and accurately predicts binding motifs for an independent set of\ndivergent homeodomains. Similarly, when trained on RNAcompete profiles for\ndiverse RBPs, our model correctly predicts the binding affinities of held-out\nproteins and identifies key RNA-binding residues, despite the high level of\nsequence divergence across RBPs. We expect that the method will be broadly\napplicable to modeling and predicting paired macromolecular interactions in\nsettings where high-throughput affinity data are available.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nbt.3343 \nPMCID: PMC4871164\nPMID: 26571099  [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]\n\n",

SiMCAn enables rapid interpretation of complex single-molecule\nbehaviors and should prove useful for the comprehensive analysis of a plethora of\ndynamic cellular machines.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3602 \nPMCID: PMC4890712 [Available on 2016-11-01]\nPMID: 26414013  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Many\ncomputational methods have been developed to tackle this problem. Here we\nassessed 13 well-known methods using 24 data sets ranging from gene expression to\nprotein domains. Performance was judged on the basis of 13 common cluster\nvalidity indices. We developed a clustering analysis platform, ClustEval\n(http://clusteval.mpi-inf.mpg.de), to promote streamlined evaluation, comparison \nand reproducibility of clustering results in the future. This allowed us to\nobjectively evaluate the performance of all tools on all data sets with up to\n1,000 different parameter sets each, resulting in a total of more than 4 million \ncalculated cluster validity indices. We observed that there was no universal best\nperformer, but on the basis of this wide-ranging comparison we were able to\ndevelop a short guideline for biomedical clustering tasks. ClustEval allows\nbiomedical researchers to pick the appropriate tool for their data type and\nallows method developers to compare their tool to the state of the art.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3583 \nPMID: 26389570  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We performed histone acetylation ChIP-seq on 57 human\nlymphoblastoid cell lines and used the resulting reads to call 500,066\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms de novo within regulatory elements. The G-SCI\ntest annotated 8,764 of these as histone acetylation QTLs (haQTLs)—an order of\nmagnitude larger than the set of candidates detected by expression QTL analysis. \nLymphoblastoid haQTLs were highly predictive of autoimmune disease mechanisms.\nThus, our method facilitates large-scale regulatory variant detection in any\nmoderately sized cohort for which functional profiling data can be generated,\nthereby simplifying identification of causal variants within GWAS loci.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3326 \nPMID: 25799442  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We encoded structural data derived from\nnative MS, bottom-up proteomics, ion mobility-MS and chemical cross-linking MS\ninto modeling restraints to compute the most likely structure of a protein\nassembly. We used the method to generate near-native models for three known\nstructures and characterized an assembly intermediate of the proteasomal base.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2841 \nPMCID: PMC3972104\nPMID: 24509631  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

We applied mmPCR-seq to RNA editing and \nallele-specific expression studies. mmPCR-seq complements RNA-seq for studying\nallelic variations in the transcriptome.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/nmeth.2736 \nPMCID: PMC3877737\nPMID: 24270603  [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n",

Hoffmann-La Roche AG, CH-4070 Basel,\nSwitzerland.\n\nMOTIVATION: The increasing diversity of data available to the biomedical\nscientist holds promise for better understanding of diseases and discovery of new\ntreatments for patients. In order to provide a complete picture of a biomedical\nquestion, data from many different origins needs to be combined into a unified\nrepresentation. During this data integration process, inevitable errors and\nambiguities present in the initial sources compromise the quality of the\nresulting data warehouse, and greatly diminish the scientific value of the\ncontent. Expensive and time-consuming manual curation is then required to improve\nthe quality of the information. However, it becomes increasingly difficult to\ndedicate and optimize the resources for data integration projects as available\nrepositories are growing both in size and in number everyday.\nRESULTS: We present a new generic methodology to identify problematic records,\ncausing what we describe as 'data hairball' structures. The approach is\ngraph-based and relies on two metrics traditionally used in social sciences: the \ngraph density and the betweenness centrality. We evaluate and discuss these\nmeasures and show their relevance for flexible, optimized and automated data\ncuration and linkage. The methodology focuses on information coherence and\ncorrectness to improve the scientific meaningfulness of data integration\nendeavors, such as knowledge bases and large data warehouses.\nCONTACT: samuel.croset@roche.com\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.\n\n© The Author 2015.
